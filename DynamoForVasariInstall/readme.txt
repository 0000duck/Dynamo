Dynamo: Visual Programming for Revit

This project was started by Ian Keough. The intent of this project is to provide a code playground for building interesting parametric functionality on top of that already offered by Revit, and to do so with a graphical interface that allows you to share your work with others less inclined to write code themselves.

It has been developed based on feedback from several parties inlcuding Buro Happold Engineers, and students and faculty at the USC School of Architecture.
