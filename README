Dynamo: Visual Programming for Revit

This project was started by Ian Keough. The intent of this project is to provide a code playground for building interesting parametric functionality on top of that already offered by Revit, and to do so with a graphical interface that allows you to share your work with others less inclined to write code themselves.

It has been developed based on feedback from several parties inlcuding Buro Happold Engineers, and students and faculty at the USC School of Architecture.

==============================================================================


Autodesk has contributed new concepts, features and implementation into the Dynamo Open Source project. 

The current version will run on top of Revit 2013 and Project Vasari Beta 1. It will be released as a new Project Vasari WIP soon but is available now experimental form on github.

Key new features :

- User Interface - side panel to allow you to search and then drag and drop new nodes in to place
- User-created nodes – you can make 'sub-nodes' and then reference them elsewhere, these act like writing a reusable function in a programming language
- Python Scripting node – we have integrated a python scripting node into 
- Math, logic and other nodes – many new nodes added to support evaluation,  iteration and looping

Dynamo For Vasari Beta 1 WIP: Integrating Dynamo into Project Vasari and extending Dynamo to support integrated analysis and performance-based design.
