Dynamorph, morph the heck out of your design.

## Tasks (Prioritized) ##

- [x] Implement first cut Camera class
- [x] Enable shader uniform passing from C++
- [x] Update background color fill to RGB(30, 30, 30)
- [x] Use GLM for transformation matrix computation
- [x] Add bounding box to IVertexBuffer class
- [x] Fit camera to bounding sphere of IVertexBuffer
- [ ] Implement SynthesizedGraph/Node/Edge classes
- [ ] Provide helper to synthesize Dynamo graph 
- [ ] Implement layout/rendering for synthesized graph
- [ ] Implement saving of tessellated data to bin file
- [ ] Implement loading of tessellated data from file
- [ ] Design structure to keep node-geometry data
- [ ] Add shader uniform to control per-vertex alpha
- [ ] Add slider to work with synthesized graph
- [ ] Enable slider to work with C++ Visualizer

- [ ] Move shader source to external files
- [ ] Implement logging mechanism
- [ ] Display OpenGL logs in Dynamorph window
- [ ] Implement Track Ball class for navigation
- [ ] Update aspect ratio when window is sized
- [ ] Implement mini-ball for tightest bounding box
- [ ] Add GLM licence terms to EULA and ReadMe.md

## Screenshot Of The Day ##
This is the latest screenshot of Dynamorph. It will be updated as and when there is any visible change to Dynamorph to reflect the latest development.

#### Camera is now fitting to the bounding sphere! :) ####
