In this chapter, we will walk through how to clone the repository using git, compile the source files with Visual Studio, run and debug a local build, and pull any new changes  from Github.\nLocating the Dynamo repositories on Github\nGithub is a hosting service based on git, a version control system for tracking changes and coordinating work between people. Git is a tool we can leverage to download Dynamo's source files, and keep them updated with a few commands. Using this method will avoid the unnecessary and inherently messy work of downloading and manually replacing the source files at every update. The git version control system will track any differences between a local and remote code repository.\nDynamo's source is hosted on the DynamoDS Github in this repository: https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo\n\n\nThe Dynamo source files.  \n\nClone or download the entire repository  \nView other DynamoDS repositories  \nDynamo's source files  \nGit specific files\n\n\nPulling the Dynamo repository using git\nBefore we can clone the repository, we need to install git. Follow this short guide for installation steps, and how to setup a gihub username and email. For this example, we will be using git on the command line. This guide assumes you will be using windows but you can also use git on mac or linux to clone the dynamo source.\nWe need a URL for the Dynamo repository to clone from. This can be found in the \"Clone or download\" button on the repository page. Copy the URL to paste into command prompt.\n\n\n\nSelect \"Clone or download\"\nCopy the URL\n\n\nWith git installed, we can clone the Dynamo repository. Start by opening command prompt. Then use the change directory command cd  to navigate to the folder where we want the source files to be cloned to. In this case, we have created a folder called Github in Documents.\ncd C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\GitHub\n\nReplace \"username\" with your user name\n\n\nIn the next step we will run a git command to clone the Dynamo repository to the location we specified. The URL in the command is obtained by clicking on the \"Clone or Download\" button on Github. Run this command in the command terminal. Note that this will clone the Dynamo repo master branch which is most updated code for Dynamo, and will contain to the latest version of Dynamo code. This branch changes daily.\ngit clone https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo.git\n\nWe know git is working if the cloning operation completed successfully. In the file explorer, navigate to the directory where you cloned to see the source files. the directory structure should look identical to the Dynamo repository's master branch on Github.\n\n\n\nDynamo's source files\nGit files\n\n\nBuilding the repository using Visual Studio\nWith the source files now cloned to our local machine, we can build an executable file for Dynamo. In order to do this, we will need to set up the Visual Studio IDE and ensure that the .NET Framework and DirectX are installed.\n\nDownload and install Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015, a free, fully-featured IDE (integrated development environment - later versions may work as well)\nDownload and install Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or later\nInstall Microsoft DirectX from the local Dynamo repository (Dynamo\\tools\\install\\Extra\\DirectX\\DXSETUP.exe)\n\n\n.NET and DirectX may already be installed.\n\nOnce everything is finished installing, we can start Visual Studio and open the Dynamo.All.sln solution located in Dynamo\\src.\n\n\n\nSelect File > Open > Project/Solution\nBrowse to the Dynamo repository and open the src folder\nSelect the Dynamo.All.sln solution file\nSelect Open\n\n\nBefore we can build the solution, a few settings should be specified. We should first build a debug version of Dynamo so visual studio can gather more information while debugging to help us develop, and we want to target AnyCPU.\n\n\nThese will become folders inside the bin folder  \n\nFor this example we chose Debug as the Solution Configuration   \nSet the Solution Platform to Any CPU\n\n\nWith the project open, we can build the solution. This process will create a DynamoSandbox.exe file that we can run.\n\n\nBuilding the project will restore NuGet dependencies.  \n\nSelect Build > Build Solution  \nVerify that the build was successful in the Output window, it should read similar to ==== Build: 69 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ====\n\n\nRunning a local build\nIf Dynamo builds successfully, a bin folder will be created in the Dynamo repository with the DynamoSandbox.exe file. In our case, we're building with the Debug option, so the executable file is located in bin\\AnyCPU\\Debug. Running this will open a local build of Dynamo.\n\n\n\nThe DynamoSandbox executable we just built. Run this to start Dynamo.\n\n\nNow we are almost fully set up to start developing for Dynamo.\nFor instructions on building Dynamo for other platforms (e.g. Linux or OS X) visit this wiki page.\nDebugging a local build using Visual Studio\nDebugging is a process of identifying, isolating, and correcting a bug or issue. Once Dynamo has been successfully built from source, we can use several tools in Visual Studio to debug a running application, the DynamoRevit add-in for example. We can  analyze its source code to find the root of an issue, or watch the currently executing code. For a more detailed explanation of how to debug and navigate code in Visual Studio, refer to the Visual Studio Docs.\nFor the standalone Dynamo application, DynamoSandbox, we will cover two options for debugging:\n\nBuild and start Dynamo directly from Visual Studio\nAttach Visual Studio to a running process of Dynamo\n\nStarting Dynamo from Visual Studio rebuilds the solution for every debugging session if required, so if we made changes to the source they will be incorporated when debugging. With the Dynamo.All.sln solution still open, select Debug, AnyCPU, and DynamoSandbox from the drop-down menus and then click Start. This will build Dynamo and start a new process (DynamoSandbox.exe), and attach Visual Studio's debugger to it.\n\n\nBuild and start the application directly from Visual Studio  \n\nSet configuration to Debug  \nSet platform to Any CPU  \nSet startup project to DynamoSandbox  \nClick Start to begin the debugging process\n\n\nAlternatively, we may want to debug a Dynamo process that is already running to troubleshoot an issue with a specific graph open or package. For this purpose, we would open the project's source files in Visual Studio and attach to a running Dynamo process using the Attach to Process debug menu item.\n\n\nAttach a running process to Visual Studio  \n\nSelect Debug > Attach to Process...  \nChoose DynamoSandbox.exe  \nSelect Attach\n\n\nIn both situations we are attaching the debugger to a process we wish to debug. We can set break points in the code before or after starting the debugger that will cause the process to pause immediately before executing that line of code. If an uncaught exception is thrown while debugging, Visual Studio will jump to where it occurred in the source code. This is an efficient method for finding simple crashes, unhandled exceptions, and to understand the execution flow of an application.\n\n\nWhile debugging DynamoSandbox, we set a breakpoint in the Color.ByARGB node's constructor that causes the Dynamo process to pause when the node is instantiated. If this node was throwing an exception or causing Dynamo to crash, we could step through each line in the constructor to find where the issue was occurring.   \n\nThe breakpoint  \nThe call stack showing the function which is currently being executed and previous function calls.\n\n\nIn the next section, Build DynamoRevit from Source, we will walk through a specific example of debugging, and explain how to set break points, step through code, and read the call stack.\nPulling latest build\nSince the Dynamo source is hosted on Github, the easiest way to keep local source files updated is by pulling changes using git commands.\nUsing the command line, set the current directory to the Dynamo repository:\ncd C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\GitHub\\Dynamo\n\nReplace \"username\" with your username\n\nUse the following command to pull the latest changes:\ngit pull origin master\n\n\n\nHere we can see that the local repository has been updated with changes from the remote.\n\n\nIn addition to pulling updates, there are four more git workflows to be familiar with.\n\nFork the Dynamo repository to create a copy separate from the original. Any changes made here will not affect the original repository and updates can be fetched from or submitted with pull requests. Fork is not a git command, but is a workflow that github adds -  the fork, pull request model is one of the most common workflows for contributing to open source projects online. It is worth learning if you want to contribute to Dynamo.\n\nBranch - work on experiments or new features isolated from other work in branches. This makes sending pull requests easier.\n\nMake commits often, after completing a unit of work, and after a change that may want to be undone. A commit records changes to the repository and will be visible when making a pull request to the main Dynamo repository.\n\nCreate pull requests when  changes are ready to be officially proposed to the main Dynamo repository.\n\n\nThe Dynamo team has specific instructions on creating pull requests.

For example, DynamoRevit 2.x will not load into Dynamo 1.3.\nDynamoRevit is specific to Revit versions, for example: the DynamoRevit 2018 branch should run on Revit 2018.\n\nFor this guide we will use the following:\n\nRevit 2018\nThe latest DynamoRevit build on branch Revit2018\nThe latest Dynamo build\n\nTo ensure a successful build we will clone and build both the Dynamo and DynamoRevit repositories to use in this walk-through. \nNote: building Dynamo manually before DynamoRevit is only required if you are building Dynamo 1.x and DynamoRevit 1.x - newer versions of the DynamoRevit repository rely on the nuget package manager for the Dynamo dependencies required to build. While a build of DynamoRevit 2.x does not require pulling Dynamo manually you'll still need the core dlls somewhere else to actually run the DynamoRevit addin - so it's worth pulling and building Dynamo anyway. See more below: Building the repository using Visual Studio\nLocating the DynamoRevit repository on Github\nThe code for the DynamoRevit project lives in a separate repository on Github from the core Dynamo source code. This repo contains the the source files for Revit-specific nodes and the Revit addin which loads Dynamo. Builds of DynamoRevit for different versions of Revit (2016, 2017, or 2018, for example) are organized as branches in the repository.\nDynamoRevit's source is hosted here: https://github.com/DynamoDS/DynamoRevit\n\n\n\nClone or download the repository\nDynamoRevit's branches reference Revit versions\n\n\nCloning the repository using git\nIn a similar process to pulling the Dynamo repository we will use the git clone command to clone DynamoRevit and specify the branch that matches our Revit version. To get started, we will open a command line interface and set the current directory to the location where we want to clone the files to.\ncd C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\GitHub changes the current directory\n\nReplace username with your username\n\n\nWe can now clone the repository into this directory. Though we will need to specify a branch of the repository, we can switch to this branch after cloning.\ngit clone https://github.com/DynamoDS/DynamoRevit.git clones the repository from a remote URL and by default switches to the master branch.\n\nOnce the repository has finished cloning, change the current directory to the repository folder and switch to the branch that matches the installed version of Revit. For this example, we are using Revit 2018. All remote branches can be viewed on the Github page in the Branch drop-down menu.\ncd C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\GitHub\\DynamoRevit changes the directory to DynamoRevit.git checkout Revit2018 sets the current branch to Revit2018.git branch verifies which branch we are on and shows the others that exist locally.\n\n\nThe branch with an asterisk is the one currently checked out. The Revit2017 branch is showing because we previously checked it out, so it exists locally.\n\nIt is important to choose the correct branch of the repository to ensure that when the project builds in Visual Studio it will reference assemblies in the correct version of Revit's installation directory, specifically RevitAPI.dll and RevitAPIUI.dll.\nBuilding the repository using Visual Studio \nBefore building the repository, we will need to restore the NuGet packages with the restorepackages.bat file located in the src folder. This bat file uses the nuget package manager to pull built binaries of dynamo core, which DynamoRevit needs. You might also choose to build these manually, but if you are only making changes to DynamoRevit and not Dynamo core. this makes getting started faster. Make sure to run this file as an admin.\n\n\n\nRight-click restorepackages.bat and select Run as administrator\n\n\nIf the packages are successfully restored, a packages folder will be added to the src folder with the latest beta NuGet packages.\n\n\n\nThe latest beta Dynamo NuGet packages\n\n\nWith the packages restored, open the Dynamo.Revit.2013.sln Visual Studio solution file in src and build the solution. The build may initially have trouble finding AssemblySharedInfo.cs. If so, rerunning the build will resolve this issue.\n\n\n\nSelect Build > Build Solution\nVerify that the build was successful in the Output window. A message should read ===== Build: 13 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped =====.\n\n\nRunning a local build of DynamoRevit in Revit\nRevit requires an add-in file to recognize DynamoRevit, something the installer would create automatically. In development we need to manually create an add-in file that points to the build of DynamoRevit we want to use, specifically the DynamoRevitDS.dll assembly. We also need to point DynamoRevit to a build of Dynamo.\nCreate a Dynamo.addin file in Revit's add-in folder located in C:\\ProgramData\\Autodesk\\Revit\\Addins\\2018. We already had a version of DynamoRevit installed, so we will just edit the existing file to point to the new build.\n\n\n\nDynamo For Revit\n\"C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\GitHub\\DynamoRevit\\bin\\AnyCPU\\Debug\\Revit_2018\\DynamoRevitDS.dll\"\n8D83C886-B739-4ACD-A9DB-1BC78F315B2B\nDynamo.Applications.DynamoRevitApp\nADSK\nDynamo\n\n\n\n\nSpecify the file path of DynamoRevitDS.dll inside of ....\n\nAlternatively, we can have the add-in load the version selector instead of a specific assembly.\n\n\n\nDynamo For Revit\n\"C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\GitHub\\DynamoRevit\\bin\\AnyCPU\\Debug\\Revit_2018\\DynamoRevitVersionSelector.dll\"\n8D83C886-B739-4ACD-A9DB-1BC78F315B2B\nDynamo.Applications.VersionLoader\nADSK\nDynamo\n\n\n\n\nSet the ... file path to DynamoRevitVersionSelector.dll\n... specifies what class to instantiate from the assembly which we pointed to with the assembly element path above. This class will be the entry point for our addin.\n\nThe second step is to add a file path for the Dynamo core assemblies to the Dynamo.config file in DynamoRevit's bin folder. DynamoRevit will load these when the add-in is opened in Revit. This config file lets you point your DynamoRevit addin to different versions of the dynamo core for developing and testing changes in both core and DynamoRevit. \nThe code should look like this:\n\n\n  \n     \n  \n\n\n\nAdd the bin folder's directory path to \n\n\nWe cloned and built Dynamo right before this walk-through to ensure that it will work well with DynamoRevit. The directory path points to this build.\n\nNow when we open Revit, there should be a Dynamo add-in located in the Manage tab.\n\n\n\nSelect Manage\nClick the Dynamo add-in icon\nAn instance of DynamoRevit\n\n\nIf an error dialog window appears showing missing assemblies, it is likely that there was a mismatch between the versions of DynamoCore that you built against and the ones you are loading at runtime. For example, DynamoRevit with the latest 2.0 beta packages of DynamoCore will not work if you try to start it using  Dynamo 1.3 dlls. Make sure that both repos are of the same version and DynamoRevit is pulling a matching version of the nuget dependencies. These are defined in the package.json  file of the DynamoRevit repo.\nDebugging DynamoRevit using Visual Studio\nIn the previous section, Build Dynamo from Source, we briefly introduced debugging in Visual Studio and how to attach visual studio to a process. Using an exception in the Wall.ByCurveAndHeight node as an example, we will walk through how to attach to a process, set break points, step through code, and use the call stack to determine the exception's source. These debugging tools apply generally to .net development workflows, and are worth exploring outside of this guide.\n\nAttach to process links a running application to Visual Studio for debugging. If we want to debug behavior occurring in a build of DynamoRevit, we can open the DynamoRevit source files in Visual Studio and attach the Revit.exe process, which is the parent process of the DynamoRevit addin. Visual Studio uses a symbol file (.pbd) to make the connection between the assemblies DynamoRevit is executing and the source code.\n\nBreak points establish lines in the source code where the application will pause before executing. If a node is causing DynamoRevit to crash or return an unexpected result, we can add a break point to the node's source to pause the process,  step into the code, and inspect live values of variables until we find the root of the problem\n\nStepping through code walks through the source line by line. We can run functions one by one, step into a function call, or jump out of the function we're currently executing.\n\nThe Call stack shows the function that a process is currently running relative to the previous function calls which invoked this function call. Visual Studio has a Call Stack window to display this. For example, if we reach an exception outside of the source code, we can see the path to the calling code in the call stack.\n\n2,000 Things You Should Know About C# has a more in-depth explanation of call stacks\n\n\n\nThe Wall.ByCurveAndHeight node throws an exception when given a PolyCurve as its curve input with the message: \"To BSPlineCurve Not Implemented\". With debugging we can figure out why exactly the node won't accept this geometry type as an input for the curve parameter. For this example, we are assuming that DynamoRevit has been successfully built and can be run as an add-in for Revit.\n\n\n\nThe Wall.ByCurveAndHeight node throwing an exception\n\n\nStart by opening the DynamoRevit.2013.sln solution file, start Revit, and start the DynamoRevit add-in. Then attach Visual Studio to the Revit process with the Attach to Process window.\n\n\nRevit and DynamoRevit need to be running to show as an available process  \n\nOpen the Attach to Process window by selecting Debug > Attach to Process...  \nSet Transport to Default  \nSelect Revit.exe  \nSelect Attach\n\n\nWith Visual Studio attached to Revit, open the Wall.ByCurveAndHeight source code in Wall.cs. We can find this in the Solution Explorer under Libraries > RevitNodes > Elements in the Public static constructors region of the file. Set a break point in the constructor of the wall type so that when node is executed in Dynamo, the process will break and we can step through each line of code individually. Usually Dynamo zero touch type constructors start with By.\n\n\n\nThe class file with the constructor for Wall.ByCurveAndHeight\nSet a breakpoint by either clicking left of the line number or right-clicking on the line of code and select Breakpoint > Insert Breakpoint.\n\n\nWith the breakpoint set, we need the process to run through the Wall.ByCurveAndHeight function. The function can be executed again in Dynamo by reconnecting a wire to one of its ports, which will force the node to re-execute. The breakpoint will be hit in Visual Studio.\n\n\n\nThe breakpoint icon changes when it is hit\nThe Call Stack window showing the method that is up next\n\n\nNow step over each line in the constructor until we hit the exception. Code highlighted in yellow is the next statement to be run.\n\n\n\nThe debugging tools for navigating code\nPress Step Over to run the highlighted code then suspend execution after the function returns\nThe next statement to run indicated by the yellow highlight and arrow\n\n\nIf we keep stepping through the function, we will hit the exception that displayed in the DynamoRevit window. Looking at the Call Stack window, we can see that the exception is coming from the Autodesk.LibG.PolyCurve.to_nurbs_curve() method in LibG.Managed.dll. Thankfully the exception is handled here so Dynamo did not crash. The debugging process has provided context for the issue by bringing us to another method in the source code. \nLibG.managed.dll is not an open source library so we cannot make changes there - now that we have more information we can report the issue with more context by filing a github issue or we could propose a workaround for this issue making a pull request. \n\n\n\nWhen we hit the statement causing the exception in Walls.cs, the debugging process brings us as close as it could to the root of the issue in the user code inside ProtoToRevitCurve.cs\nThe statement causing the exception in ProtoToRevitCurve.cs\nIn the Call Stack, we can see that the exception is coming from non-user code in LibG.Managed.dll\nA pop-up window giving us information about the exception\n\n\nThis process can be applied to any source files we are working with. If we are developing a library of Zero-Touch nodes for Dynamo Studio, we can open the library's source and attach a Dynamo process to debug the node library. Even if everything is functioning perfectly, debugging is a great way to explore code and find out how things are working.\nPull latest build\nThis process is nearly identical to pulling changes for Dynamo, except that we will need to ensure that we are on the correct branch. Use the git branch command in the DynamoRevit repository to see which branches are available locally and which are currently checked out.\ncd C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\GitHub\\DynamoRevit sets the current directory to the DynamoRevit repository.git branch verifies we are on the correct branch, Revit2017.git pull origin Revit2017 pulls changes from the remote origin Revit2017 branch. \nOrigin simply points to the original url we cloned.\n\n\nWe want to be mindful here of which branch we are currently on and which one we are pulling from to avoid pulling changes from Revit2018 into Revit2017 for example.\n\nAs mentioned in Build Dynamo from Source, when we are ready to submit a change to the DynamoRevit repository we can create a pull request following the Dynamo team's guidelines laid out in the Pull Requests section.\n"},"03-Development-Options/3-0-developing-for-dynamo.html":{"url":"03-Development-Options/3-0-developing-for-dynamo.html","title":"Developing for Dynamo","keywords":"","body":"Developing for Dynamo\nRegardless of experience level, the Dynamo platform is designed for all users to be contributors. There are several development options that target different abilities and skill levels, each with its strengths and weaknesses depending on the goal. Below we will outline the different options and how to choose one over another.\n\n\nThree development environments: Visual Studio, Python Editor, and Code Block DesignScript\n\nWhat are my options?\nDevelopment options for Dynamo fall primarily into two categories: for Dynamo versus in Dynamo. The two categories can be thought about as; \"in\" Dynamo implies content that is created using the Dynamo IDE to be used in Dynamo, and \"for\" Dynamo implies using external tools to create content to be imported into Dynamo to be used. Though this guide is focused on development for Dynamo, resources for all processes are described below.\nFor Dynamo\nThese nodes allow for the highest degree of customization. Many packages are built with this method, and it is necessary for contributing to Dynamo's source. The process of building them will be covered in this guide.\n\nZero-Touch Nodes\nNodeModel derived Nodes\nExtensions\n\n\nThe Primer has a guide on importing Zero-Touch libraries.\n\nFor the discussion below Visual Studio is used as the development environment for Zero-Touch and NodeModel nodes.\n\n\nThe Visual Studio interface with a project that we will be developing\n\nIn Dynamo\nThough these processes exist in the visual programming workspace and are relatively straight forward, they are all viable options for customizing Dynamo. The Primer covers these extensively and provides scripting tips and best practices in the Scripting Strategies chapter.\n\nCode Blocks expose DesignScript in the visual programming environment, allowing for flexible text-script and node workflows. A function in a code block can be called by anything in the workspace. \n\nDownload a Code Block example (Right-click and save as) or see a detailed walk-through in the Primer.\n\n\nCustom Nodes are containers for collections of nodes or even entire graphs. They are an effective way to collect frequently used routines and share them with the community.\n\nDownload a Custom Node example (Right-click and save as) or see a detailed walk-through in the Primer.\n\n\nPython Nodes are a scripting interface in the visual programming workspace, similar to code blocks. The Autodesk.DesignScript libraries use a dot notation similar to DesignScript.\n\nDownload a Python Node example (Right-click and save as) or see a detailed walk-through in the Primer\n\n\n\nDeveloping in the Dynamo workspace is a powerful tool for getting immediate feedback.\n\n\nDeveloping in the Dynamo workspace with the Python Node\n\nWhat are the advantages/disadvantages of each?\nDevelopment options for Dynamo have been designed to address the complexity of a customization need. Whether the goal is to write a recursive script in Python or build an entirely custom node UI, there are options for implementing code that involve only what's necessary to get up and running.\nCode Blocks, the Python Node and Custom Nodes in Dynamo\nThese are straightforward options for writing code in the Dynamo visual programming environment. The Dynamo visual programming workspace provides access to Python, DesignScript, and the ability to contain multiple nodes inside of a Custom Node.\n\nWith these methods we can:\n\nGet started writing Python or DesignScript with little to no setup.\nImport Python libraries into Dynamo.\nShare Code Blocks, Python Nodes, and Custom Nodes with the Dynamo community as part of a package.\n\nZero-Touch Nodes\nZero-Touch refers to a simple point-and-click method for importing C# libraries. Dynamo will read the public methods of a .dll and convert them to Dynamo nodes. You can use Zero-Touch to develop your own custom nodes and packages.\n\nWith this method we can:\n\nImport a library which was not necessarily developed for Dynamo and automatically create a suite of new nodes, such as the A-Forge example in the Primer\nWrite C# methods and easily use the methods as nodes in Dynamo\nShare a C# library as nodes with the Dynamo community in a package\n\nNodeModel derived Nodes\nThese nodes are a step deeper into the structure of Dynamo. They are based on the NodeModel class and written in C#. While this method provides the most flexibility and power, most aspects of the node have to be explicitly defined and functions need to live in a separate assembly.\n\nWith this method we can:\n\nCreate fully a customizable node UI with sliders, images, color, etc (e.g. ColorRange node)\nAccess and affect what's happening in the Dynamo canvas\nCustomize lacing\nLoad into Dynamo as a package\n\nUnderstanding Dynamo versioning and API changes (1.x → 2.x)\nSince Dynamo is being regularly updated, changes might be made to part of the API that a package uses. Tracking these changes is important to ensure that existing packages continue to work properly.\nAPI changes are tracked on the Dynamo Github Wiki. This covers changes to DynamoCore, Libraries, and Workspaces.\n\nAn example of an upcoming, significant change is the transition from XML to JSON file format in version 2.0. NodeModel derived nodes will now need a JSON constructor otherwise they won't open in Dynamo 2.0.\nDynamo's API documentation currently covers the core functionality: http://dynamods.github.io/DynamoAPI\n\nPermission to distribute binaries in a package\nBe aware of .dll's included in a package being uploaded to the package manager. If the package author did not create the .dll, they must have the rights to share it.\nIf a package includes binaries, users must be prompted upon downloading that the package contains binaries.\n"},"03-Development-Options/3-1-getting-started.html":{"url":"03-Development-Options/3-1-getting-started.html","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started\nBefore jumping into development, it is important to build a strong foundation for a new project. There are several project templates in the Dynamo developer community that are excellent places to start, but an understanding of how to start a project from scratch is even more valuable. Building a project from the ground up will provide a deeper understanding of the development process.\n\nCreating a Visual Studio Project\nVisual Studio is a powerful IDE where we can create a project, add references, build .dlls, and debug. When creating a new project Visual Studio will also create a Solution, a structure for organizing projects. Multiple projects can exist inside a single solution and can be built together. To create a ZeroTouch node, we will need to start a new Visual Studio project in which we will write a C# class library and build a .dll.\n\n\nThe New Project window in Visual Studio  \n\nStart by opening Visual Studio and creating a new project: File > New > Project  \nChoose the Class Library project template  \nGive the project a name (we've named the project MyCustomNode)  \nSet the file path for your project. For this example we will leave it at the default location  \nSelect Ok\n\n\nVisual Studio will automatically create and open a C# file. We should give it an appropriate name, setup the workspace, and replace the default code with this multiplication method.\n namespace MyCustomNode\n {\n     public class SampleFunctions\n     {\n         public static double MultiplyByTwo(double inputNumber)\n         {\n             return inputNumber * 2.0;\n         }\n     }\n }\n\n\n\n\nOpen the Solution Explorer and Output windows from View.\nRename the Class1.cs file to SampleFunctions.cs in the Solution explorer on the right.\nAdd the code above for the multiplication function. We will cover the specifics of how Dynamo will read your C# classes later on.\nThe Solution Explorer: this gives you access to everything in your project.\nThe Output window: we'll need this later on to see if our build was successful.\n\n\nThe next step is to build the project, but before doing that there are a few settings we need to check. First, make sure that Any CPU or x64 is selected as the Platform target and that Prefer 32-bit is unchecked in the Project Properties.\n\n\n\nOpen the project properties by selecting Project > \"ProjectName\" Properties\nSelect the Build page\nSelect Any CPU or x64 from the drop-down menu\nEnsure that Prefer 32-bit is unchecked\n\n\nNow we can build the project to create a .dll. To do this, either select Build Solution from the Build menu or use the short-cut CTRL+SHIFT+B.\n\n\n\nSelect Build > Build Solution\nYou can determine if your project built successfully by checking the Output window\n\n\nIf the project has been built successfully there will be a .dll named MyCustomNode in the project's bin folder. For this example we left the project's file path as Visual Studio's default at c:\\users\\username\\documents\\visual studio 2015\\Projects. Let's take a look at the project's file structure.\n\n\n\nThe bin folder contains the .dll built from Visual Studio.\nThe Visual Studio project file.\nThe class file.\nSince our solution configuration was set to Debug, the .dll will be created in bin\\Debug.\n\n\nNow we can open Dynamo and import the .dll. With the Add feature, navigate to the project's bin location and select the .dll to open.\n\n\n\nSelect the Add button to import a .dll\nNavigate to the project location. Our project is located in Visual Studio's default file path: C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2015\\Projects\\MyCustomNode\nSelect the MyCustomNode.dll to import\nClick Open to load the .dll\n\n\nIf a category is created in the library called MyCustomNode, the .dll was imported successfully! However, Dynamo created two nodes from what we wanted to be a single node. In the next section we will explain why this happens and how Dynamo reads a .dll.\n\n\n\nMyCustomNode in the Dynamo Library. The Library category is determined by the .dll name.\nSampleFunctions.MultiplyByTwo on the canvas.\n\n\nHow Dynamo Reads Classes and Methods\nWhen Dynamo loads a .dll, it will expose all public static methods as nodes. Constructors, methods, and properties will be turned into Create, Action, and Query nodes respectively. In our multiplication example, the MultiplyByTwo() method becomes an Action node in Dynamo. This is because the node has been named based on its method and class.\n\n\n\nThe input is named inputNumber based on the method's parameter name.\nThe output is named double by default because that is the data type being returned.\nThe node is named SampleFunctions.MultiplyByTwo because those are the class and method names.\n\n\nIn the example above, the extra SampleFunctions Create node was created because we did not explicitly provide a constructor and therefore one was automatically created. We can avoid this by creating an empty private constructor in our SampleFunctions class.\nnamespace MyCustomNode\n{\n    public class SampleFunctions\n    {\n        //The empty private constructor.\n        //This will be not imported into Dynamo.\n        private SampleFunctions() { }\n\n        //The public multiplication method. \n        //This will be imported into Dynamo.\n        public static double MultiplyByTwo(double inputNumber)\n        {\n            return inputNumber * 2.0;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nDynamo has imported our method as a Create node\n\n\nAdding Dynamo NuGet Package References\nThe multiplication node is very simple and no references to Dynamo are required. If we want to access any of Dynamo's functionality to create geometry for example, we will need to reference the Dynamo NuGet packages.\n\nZeroTouchLibrary - Package for building zero touch node libraries for Dynamo that contains the following libraries: DynamoUnits.dll, ProtoGeometry.dll\nWpfUILibrary - Package for building node libraries for Dynamo with custom UI in WPF that contains the following libraries: DynamoCoreWpf.dll, CoreNodeModels.dll, CoreNodeModelWpf.dll\nDynamoServices - DynamoServices library for Dynamo\nCore - Unit and system test infrastructure for Dynamo that contains the following libraries: DSIronPython.dll, DynamoApplications.dll, DynamoCore.dll, DynamoInstallDetective.dll, DynamoShapeManager.dll, DynamoUtilities.dll, ProtoCore.dll, VMDataBridge.dll\nTests - Unit and system test infrastructure for Dynamo that contains the following libraries: DynamoCoreTests.dll, SystemTestServices.dll, TestServices.dll\nDynamoCoreNodes - Package for building core nodes for Dynamo that contains the following libraries: Analysis.dll, GeometryColor.dll, DSCoreNodes.dll\n\nTo reference these packages in a Visual Studio project, either download the package from NuGet at the links above and manually reference the .dlls or use the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio. First we can walk through how to install them with NuGet in Visual Studio.\n\n\n\nOpen the NuGet package manager by selecting Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...\n\n\nThis is the NuGet Package Manager. This window shows what packages have been installed for the project and lets the user browse for others. If a new version of the DynamoServices package is released, packages can be updated from here or reverted to an earlier version.\n\n\n\nSelect browse and search for DynamoVisualProgramming to bring up the Dynamo Packages.\nThe Dynamo packages. Selecting one will show it's current version and description of what's inside.\nSelect the package version you need and click install. This installs a package for the specific project you are working in. Since we are using the latest stable release of Dynamo, version 1.3, choose the corresponding package version.\n\n\nTo manually add a package downloaded from the browser, open the Reference Manager from the Solution Explorer and browse for the package.\n\n\n\nRight click References and select Add Reference.\nSelect Browse to navigate to the package location.\n\n\nNow that Visual Studio is configured properly and we have successfully added a .dll to Dynamo, we have a solid foundation for the concepts going forward. This is only the beginning, so keep following along to learn more about how to create a custom node. \n"},"03-Development-Options/3-2-zerotouch-example.html":{"url":"03-Development-Options/3-2-zerotouch-example.html","title":"Zero-Touch Case Study - Grid Node","keywords":"","body":"Zero-Touch Case Study - Grid Node\nWith a Visual Studio project up and running, we will walk through how to build a custom node that creates a rectangular grid of cells. Though we could create this with several standard nodes, it is a useful tool that can be easily contained in a Zero-Touch node. As opposed to grid lines, cells can be scaled about their center points, queried for their corner vertices, or built into faces.\nThis example will touch on a few of the features and concepts to be aware of when creating a Zero-Touch node. After we build the custom node and add it to Dynamo, make sure review the Going Further with Zero-Touch page for a deeper look at default input values, returning multiple values, documentation, objects, using Dynamo geometry types, and migrations.\n\nCustom Rectangular Grid Node\nTo start building the grid node, create a new Visual Studio class library project. Refer to the Getting Started page for an in-depth walk-through of how to set up a project.\n\n\n\nChoose Class Library for the project type\nName the project CustomNodes\n\n\nSince we will be creating geometry, we need to reference the appropriate NuGet package.

However, we may want to create tooltips for input ports or give the node a summary like the standard Dynamo nodes. Adding these features to custom nodes makes them easier to use, especially if a user wants to search for them in the Library.\n\n\n\nA default input value\nA tool tip for the xCount input\n\n\nThe RectangularGrid node needs some of these basic features. In the code below, we have added input and output port descriptions, a summary, and default input values.\nusing Autodesk.DesignScript.Geometry;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\nnamespace CustomNodes\n{\n    public class Grids\n    {\n        /// \n        /// This method creates a rectangular grid from an X and Y count.\n        /// \n        /// Number of grid cells in the X direction\n        /// Number of grid cells in the Y direction\n        /// A list of rectangles\n        /// grid, rectangle\n        public static List RectangularGrid(int xCount = 10, int yCount = 10)\n        {\n            double x = 0;\n            double y = 0;\n\n            var pList = new List();\n\n            for (int i = 0; i \n\nGive the inputs default values by assigning values to the method parameters: RectangularGrid(int xCount = 10, int yCount = 10)\n\nCreate input and output tooltips, search keywords, and a summary with XML documentation preceded by ///. \n\n\nTo add tooltips, we need an xml file in the project directory. A .xml can be automatically generated by Visual Studio by enabling the option.\n\n\n\nEnable XML documentation file here and specify a file path. This generates an XML file.\n\n\nThat's it! We have created a new node with several standard features. The following chapter Zero-Touch Basics goes into greater detail about Zero-Touch node development and the issues to be aware of.\n"},"03-Development-Options/3-3-python-scripts-in-csharp.html":{"url":"03-Development-Options/3-3-python-scripts-in-csharp.html","title":"Zero-Touch Case Study - Python Scripts in C#","keywords":"","body":"Executing Python Scripts in Zero-Touch Nodes (C#)\nIf you are comfortable writing scripts in Python and want more functionality out of the standard Dynamo Python nodes, we can use Zero-Touch to create our own. Let's start with a simple example that allows us to pass a python script as a string to a Zero-Touch node where the script is executed and a result is returned. This case study will build on the walk-throughs and examples in the Getting Started section, please refer to those if you are completely new to creating Zero-Touch nodes.\n\n\nA Zero-Touch node that will execute a Python script string\n\nPython Engine\nThis node relies on an instance of the IronPython scripting engine.  To do this, we need to reference a few additional assemblies. Follow the steps below to setup a basic template in Visual Studio:\n\nCreate a new Visual Studio class project\nAdd a reference to the IronPython.dll located in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IronPython 2.7\\IronPython.dll\nAdd a reference to the Microsoft.Scripting.dll located in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IronPython 2.7\\Platforms\\Net40\\Microsoft.Scripting.dll\nInclude the IronPython.Hosting and Microsoft.Scripting.Hosting using statements in your class\nAdd an private empty constructor to prevent an additional node from being added to the Dynamo library with our package\nCreate a new method that takes a single string as an input parameter\nWithin this method we will instantiate a new Python engine, and create an empty script scope.  You can imagine this scope as the global variables within an instance of the Python interpreter\nNext, call Execute on the engine passing the input string and the scope as parameters\nFinally, retrieve and return the results of the script by calling GetVariable on the scope and passing the name of the variable from your Python script that contains the value you are trying to return.  (See the example below for further details)\n\nThe following code provides an example for the step mentioned above. Building the solution will create a new .dll located in the bin folder of our project.  This .dll can now be imported into Dynamo as part of a package or by navigating toFile \nusing IronPython.Hosting;\nusing Microsoft.Scripting.Hosting;\n\nnamespace PythonLibrary\n{\n    public class PythonZT\n    {\n        // Unless a constructor is provided, Dynamo will automatically create one and add it to the library\n        // To avoid this, create a private constructor\n        private PythonZT() { }\n\n        // The method that executes the Python string\n        public static string executePyString(string pyString)\n        {\n            ScriptEngine engine = Python.CreateEngine();\n            ScriptScope scope = engine.CreateScope();\n            engine.Execute(pyString, scope);\n            // Return the value of the 'output' variable from the Python script below\n            var output = scope.GetVariable(\"output\");\n            return (output);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe Python script is returning the variable output, which means we will need an output variable in the Python script. Use this sample script to test the node in Dynamo. If you have ever used the Python node in Dynamo the following should look familiar. For more information check out the Python section of the primer.\nimport clr\nclr.AddReference('ProtoGeometry')\nfrom Autodesk.DesignScript.Geometry import *\n\ncube = Cuboid.ByLengths(10,10,10);\nvolume = cube.Volume\noutput = str(volume)\n\nMultiple Outputs\nOne limitation of the standard Python nodes is that they only have a single output port so if we wish to return multiple object we must construct a list and retrieve each object in. If we modify the example above to return a dictionary, we can add as many output ports as we want. Refer to the Returning Multiple Values section in Going Further With Zero-Touch for more specifics on dictionaries.\n\n\nThis node is allowing us to return both the cuboid's volume and its centroid.\n\nLet's modify the previous example with these steps:\n\nAdd a reference to DynamoServices.dll from the NuGet package manager\nIn addition to the previous assemblies include System.Collections.Generic and Autodesk.DesignScript.Runtime\nModify the return type on our method to return a dictionary which will contain our outputs\nEach output must be individually retrieved from the scope (consider setting up a simple loop for larger sets of outputs)\n\nusing IronPython.Hosting;\nusing Microsoft.Scripting.Hosting;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing Autodesk.DesignScript.Runtime;\n\nnamespace PythonLibrary\n{\n    public class PythonZT\n    {\n        private PythonZT() { }\n\n        [MultiReturn(new[] { \"output1\", \"output2\" })]\n        public static Dictionary executePyString(string pyString)\n        {\n            ScriptEngine engine = Python.CreateEngine();\n            ScriptScope scope = engine.CreateScope();\n            engine.Execute(pyString, scope);\n            // Return the value of 'output1' from script\n            var output1 = scope.GetVariable(\"output1\");\n            // Return the value of 'output2' from script\n            var output2 = scope.GetVariable(\"output2\");\n            // Define the names of outputs and the objects to return\n            return new Dictionary {\n                { \"output1\", (output1) },\n                { \"output2\", (output2) }\n            };\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWe have also added an additional output variable (output2) to the sample python script. Keep in mind that these variables can use any legal Python naming conventions, output has been used strictly for the sake of clarity in this example.\nimport clr\nclr.AddReference('ProtoGeometry')\nfrom Autodesk.DesignScript.Geometry import *\n\ncube = Cuboid.ByLengths(10,10,10);\ncentroid = Cuboid.Centroid(cube);\nvolume = cube.Volume\noutput1 = str(volume)\noutput2 = str(centroid)\n\n"},"03-Development-Options/3-4-zerotouch-nodes.html":{"url":"03-Development-Options/3-4-zerotouch-nodes.html","title":"Going Further with Zero-Touch","keywords":"","body":"Going Further With Zero-Touch\nWith an understanding of how to create a Zero-Touch project, we can go deeper into the specifics of creating a node by walking through the ZeroTouchEssentials example on the Dynamo Github.\n\n\nMany of Dynamo's standard nodes are essentially Zero-Touch nodes, like most of the Math, Color, and DateTime nodes above.\n\nTo start, download the ZeroTouchEssentials project from here: https://github.com/DynamoDS/ZeroTouchEssentials\nIn Visual Studio, open the ZeroTouchEssentials.sln solution file and build the solution.\n\n\nThe ZeroTouchEssentials.cs file contains all the methods we will be importing into Dynamo.\n\nOpen Dynamo and import the ZeroTouchEssentials.dll to get the nodes we will be referencing in the following examples.\nThe code examples are pulled from and generally match ZeroTouchEssentials.cs. The XML documentation has been removed to keep them concise, and each code example will create the node in the image above it.\nDefault Input Values\nDynamo supports the definition of default values for input ports on a node. These default values will be supplied to the node if the ports have no connections. Defaults are expressed using the C# mechanism of specifying optional arguments in the C# Programming Guide. Default are specified in the following way:\n\nSet method parameters to a default value: inputNumber = 2.0\n\nnamespace ZeroTouchEssentials\n{\n    public class ZeroTouchEssentials\n    {\n        // Set the method parameter to a default value\n        public static double MultiplyByTwo(double inputNumber = 2.0) \n        {\n            return inputNumber * 2.0;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe default value will show up when hovering over the node input port\n\n\nReturning Multiple Values\nReturning multiple values is a bit more complex than creating multiple inputs and will need to be returned using a dictionary. The dictionary's entries become ports on the output side of the node. Multiple return ports are created in the following way:\n\nAdd using System.Collections.Generic; to use Dictionary<>.\nAdd using Autodesk.DesignScript.Runtime; to use the MultiReturn attribute. This references \"DynamoServices.dll\" from the DynamoServices NuGet package.\nAdd the [MultiReturn(new[] { \"string1\", \"string2\", ... more strings here })] attribute to the method. The strings refer to keys in the dictionary and will become the output port names.\nReturn a Dictionary<> from the function with keys that match the parameter names in the attribute: return new Dictionary\n\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing Autodesk.DesignScript.Runtime;\n\nnamespace ZeroTouchEssentials\n{\n    public class ZeroTouchEssentials\n    {\n        [MultiReturn(new[] { \"add\", \"mult\" })]\n        public static Dictionary ReturnMultiExample(double a, double b)\n        {\n            return new Dictionary\n\n                { \"add\", (a + b) },\n                { \"mult\", (a * b) }\n            };\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nRefer to this code example in ZeroTouchEssentials.cs\n\nA node that returns multiple outputs.\n\n\nNotice that there are now two output ports named according to the strings we entered for the dictionary's keys.\n\nDocumentation, Tooltips, and Search\nIt is best practice to add documentation to Dynamo nodes that describe the node's function, inputs, outputs, search tags, etc. This is done through XML documentation tags. XML documentation is created in the following way:\n\nAny comment text that is preceded by three forward slashes is considered to be documentation\nFor example: /// Documentation text and XML goes here\n\n\nAfter the three slashes, create XML tags above methods that Dynamo will read when importing the .dll\nFor example: /// ...\n\n\nEnable XML documentation in Visual Studio by selecting Project > Project Properties > Build and checking XML documentation file\n\n\n\nVisual Studio will generate an XML file at the specified location\n\nThe types of tags are as follows:\n\n/// ... is the main documentation for your node and will appear as a tooltip over your node in the left search side bar\n/// ... will create documentation for specific input parameters\n/// ... will create documentation for an output parameter\n/// ... will create documentation for multiple output parameters\n/// ... will match your node with search results based on a comma separated list. For example, if we create a node that subdivides a mesh we may want to add tags such as \"mesh\", \"subdivision\", and \"catmull-clark\".\n\nThe following is an example node with input and output descriptions, as well as a summary that will display in the Library.\nusing Autodesk.DesignScript.Geometry;\n\nnamespace ZeroTouchEssentials\n{\n    public class ZeroTouchEssentials\n    {\n        /// \n        /// This method demonstrates how to use a native geometry object from Dynamo\n        /// in a custom method\n        /// \n        /// Input Curve. This can be of any type deriving from Curve, such as NurbsCurve, Arc, Circle, etc\n        /// The twice the length of the Curve \n        /// example,curve\n        public static double DoubleLength(Curve curve)\n        {\n            return curve.Length * 2.0;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nRefer to this code example in ZeroTouchEssentials.cs\n\nNote that the code for this example node contains:\n\n\nA node summary\nAn input description\nAn output description\n\n\nObjects\nDynamo doesn't have a new keyword, so objects will need to be constructed using static construction methods. Objects are constructed in the following way:\n\nMake the constructor internal internal ZeroTouchEssentials() unless otherwise required\nConstruct the object with a static method such as public static ZeroTouchEssentials ByTwoDoubles(a, b)\n\n\nNote: Dynamo uses the \"By\" prefix to indicate a static method is a constructor, and while this is optional, using \"By\" will help your library better fit into the existing Dynamo style.\n\nnamespace ZeroTouchEssentials\n{\n    public class ZeroTouchEssentials\n    {\n        private double _a;\n        private double _b;\n\n        // Make the constructor internal\n        internal ZeroTouchEssentials(double a, double b)\n        {\n            _a = a;\n            _b = b;\n        }\n\n        // The static method that Dynamo will convert into a Create node\n        public static ZeroTouchEssentials ByTwoDoubles(double a, double b)\n        {\n            return new ZeroTouchEssentials(a, b);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nRefer to this code example in ZeroTouchEssentials.cs\n\nAfter the ZeroTouchEssentials dll has been imported there will be a ZeroTouchEssentials node in the library. This object can be created by using the ByTwoDoubles node.\n\nUsing Dynamo Geometry Types\nDynamo libraries can use native Dynamo geometry types as inputs and create new geometry as outputs. Geometry types are created in the following way:\n\nReference \"ProtoGeometry.dll\" in the project by including using Autodesk.DesignScript.Geometry; at the top of your C# file and adding the ZeroTouchLibrary NuGet package to the project.\nImportant: Manage the geometry resources that are not returned out of your functions, see the Dispose/using Statements section below.\n\n\nNote: Dynamo geometry objects are used like any other passed object to functions.\n\nusing Autodesk.DesignScript.Geometry;\n\nnamespace ZeroTouchEssentials\n{\n    public class ZeroTouchEssentials\n    {\n        // \"Autodesk.DesignScript.Geometry.Curve\" is specifying the type of geometry input, \n        // just as you would specify a double, string, or integer \n        public static double DoubleLength(Autodesk.DesignScript.Geometry.Curve curve)\n        {\n            return curve.Length * 2.0;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nRefer to this code example in ZeroTouchEssentials.cs\n\nA node that gets a curve's length and doubles it.\n\n\nThis node accepts a Curve geometry type as an input.\n\nDispose/using Statements\nGeometry resources that are not returned out of functions will need to be manually managed. The Dynamo engine will handle any geometry resources that are returned out of functions. Geometry resources that are not returned can be handled in the following ways:\n\nWith a using statement:\nusing (Point p1 = Point.ByCoordinates(0, 0, 0))\n{\n  using (Point p2 = Point.ByCoordinates(10, 10, 0))\n  {\n      return Line.ByStartPointEndPoint(p1, p2);\n  }\n}\n\n\nThe using statement is documented here\n\n\nWith manual Dispose calls:\nPoint p1 = Point.ByCoordinates(0, 0, 0);\nPoint p2 = Point.ByCoordinates(10, 10, 0);\nLine l = Line.ByStartPointEndPoint(p1, p2);\np1.Dispose();\np2.Dispose();\nreturn l;\n\n\n\nMigrations\nWhen publishing a newer version of a library, node names may change. Name changes can be specified in a migrations file so that graphs built on previous versions of a library continue to work properly when an update is made. Migrations are implemented in the following way:\n\nCreate a .xml file in the same folder as the .dll with the following format: \"BaseDLLName\".Migrations.xml\nIn the .xml, create a single ... element\nInside the migrations element, create ... elements for each name change\nFor each name change, provide an ... and ... element\n\n\n\n\nRight-click and select Add > New Item\nChoose XML File\nFor this project, we would name the migrations file ZeroTouchEssentials.Migrations.xml\n\n\nThis example code is telling Dynamo that any node named GetClosestPoint is now named ClosestPointTo.\n\n\n  \n    Autodesk.DesignScript.Geometry.Geometry.GetClosestPoint\n    Autodesk.DesignScript.Geometry.Geometry.ClosestPointTo\n  \n\n\n\nRefer to this code example in ProtoGeometry.Migrations.xml\n\nGenerics\nZero-Touch currently does not support the use of generics. They can be used, but not in the code that is directly imported where the type is not set. Methods, properties, or classes that are generic and don’t have the type set cannot be exposed.\nIn the example below, a Zero-Touch node of type T will not be imported. If the rest of the library imports into Dynamo there will be missing type exceptions.\npublic class SomeGenericClass\n{\n    public SomeGenericClass()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(typeof(T).ToString());\n    }  \n}\n\nUsing a generic type with the type set in this example will import into Dynamo.\npublic class SomeWrapper\n{\n    public object wrapped;\n    public SomeWrapper(SomeGenericClass someConstrainedType)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(this.wrapped.GetType().ToString());\n    }\n}\n\n"},"03-Development-Options/3-5-nodemodel-derived-nodes.html":{"url":"03-Development-Options/3-5-nodemodel-derived-nodes.html","title":"NodeModel Case Study - Custom UI","keywords":"","body":"NodeModel Case Study - Custom UI\nNodeModel based nodes provides significantly more flexibility and power than the Zero-Touch nodes. In this example, we will take the Zero-Touch grid node to the next level by adding an integrated slider that randomizes the rectangle size.\n\n\nThe slider scales the cells relative to their size so the user doesn't have to provide a slider with the correct range.\n\nThe Model-View-Viewmodel Pattern\nDynamo is based on the model-view-viewmodel (MVVM) software architecture pattern to keep the UI separate from the back-end. When creating ZeroTouch nodes, Dynamo does the data bind between a node's data and its UI . To create a custom UI, we have  to add the data-binding logic.\nAt a high-level there are two parts to establishing a model-view relationship in Dynamo:\n\nA NodeModel class to establish the core logic of the node (the \"model\")\nA INodeViewCustomization class to customize how the NodeModel is being viewed (the \"view\")\n\n\nNodeModel objects already have an associated view-model (NodeViewModel), so we can just focus on the model and view for custom UI.\n\nHow To Implement NodeModel\nNodeModel nodes have several significant differences from Zero-Touch nodes that we will cover in this example. Before we jump into UI customization, let's start by building out the NodeModel logic.\n1. Create project structure:\nA NodeModel node can only call functions, so we need to separate the NodeModel and functions into different libraries. The standard way of doing this for Dynamo packages is creating separate projects for each. Start by creating a new Solution to encompass the projects.\n\n\n\nSelect File > New > Project\nSelect Other Project Types to bring up the Solution option\nSelect Blank Solution\nName the solution CustomNodeModel\nSelect Ok\n\n\nCreate two C# class library projects in the solution: one for functions and one to implement the NodeModel interface.\n\n\n\nRight-click on the Solution and select Add > New Project\nChoose Class Library\nName it CustomNodeModel\nClick Ok\nRepeat the process to add another project named CustomNodeModelFunctions\n\n\nNext, we need to rename the class libraries that were automatically created and add one to the CustomNodeModel project. The class GridNodeModel implements the abstract NodeModel class, GridNodeView is used to customize the view, and GridFunction contains any functions we need to call.\n\n\n\nAdd another class by right-clicking on the CustomNodeModel project, selecting Add > New Item... and choose Class.\nIn the CustomNodeModel project, we need GridNodeModel.cs and GridNodeView.cs class\nIn the CustomNodeModelFunction project, we need a GridFunctions.cs class\n\n\nBefore we add any code to the classes, add the necessary packages for this project. CustomNodeModel will need ZeroTouchLibrary and WpfUILibrary, and CustomNodeModelFunction will only need ZeroTouchLibrary. The WpfUILibrary will be used in the UI customization we do later on, and ZeroTouchLibrary will be used for creating geometry. Packages can be added individually for projects. Since these packages have dependencies, Core and DynamoServices will be automatically installed.\n\n\n\nRight-click on a project and select Manage NuGet Packages\nInstall only the required packages for that project\n\n\nVisual Studio will copy the NuGet packages we referenced to the build directory. This can be set to false so we don't have any unnecessary files in the package.\n\n\n\nSelect Dynamo NuGet Packages\nSet Copy Local to false\n\n\n2. Inherit the NodeModel class\nAs mentioned previously, the primary aspect that makes a NodeModel node different from a ZeroTouch node is its implementation of the NodeModel class. A NodeModel node needs several functions from this class, and we can get them by adding :NodeModel after the class name.\nCopy the following code into the GridNodeModel.cs.\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing Dynamo.Graph.Nodes;\nusing CustomNodeModel.CustomNodeModelFunction;\nusing ProtoCore.AST.AssociativeAST;\nusing Autodesk.DesignScript.Geometry;\n\nnamespace CustomNodeModel.CustomNodeModel\n{\n    [NodeName(\"RectangularGrid\")]\n    [NodeDescription(\"An example NodeModel node that creates a rectangular grid. The slider randomly scales the cells.\")]\n    [NodeCategory(\"CustomNodeModel\")]\n    [InPortNames(\"xCount\", \"yCount\")]\n    [InPortTypes(\"double\", \"double\")]\n    [InPortDescriptions(\"Number of cells in the X direction\", \"Number of cells in the Y direction\")]\n    [OutPortNames(\"Rectangles\")]\n    [OutPortTypes(\"Autodesk.DesignScript.Geometry.Rectangle[]\")]\n    [OutPortDescriptions(\"A list of rectangles\")]\n    [IsDesignScriptCompatible]\n    public class GridNodeModel : NodeModel\n    {\n        private double _sliderValue;\n        public double SliderValue\n        {\n            get { return _sliderValue; }\n            set\n            {\n                _sliderValue = value;\n                RaisePropertyChanged(\"SliderValue\");\n                OnNodeModified(false);\n            }\n        }\n        public GridNodeModel()\n        {\n            RegisterAllPorts();\n        }\n        public override IEnumerable BuildOutputAst(List inputAstNodes)\n        {\n            if (!HasConnectedInput(0) || !HasConnectedInput(1))\n            {\n                return new[] { AstFactory.BuildAssignment(GetAstIdentifierForOutputIndex(0), AstFactory.BuildNullNode()) };\n            }\n            var sliderValue = AstFactory.BuildDoubleNode(SliderValue);\n            var functionCall =\n              AstFactory.BuildFunctionCall(\n                new Func>(GridFunction.RectangularGrid),\n                new List { inputAstNodes[0], inputAstNodes[1], sliderValue });\n\n            return new[] { AstFactory.BuildAssignment(GetAstIdentifierForOutputIndex(0), functionCall) };\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis different from Zero-Touch nodes. Let's understand what each part is doing.\n\nSpecify the Node attributes like Name, Category, InPort/OutPort names, InPort/OutPort types, descriptions.\n\npublic class GridNodeModel : NodeModel is a class that inherits the NodeModel class from Dynamo.Graph.Nodes.\n\npublic GridNodeModel() { RegisterAllPorts(); } is a constructor that registers the node inputs and outputs.\n\nBuildOutputAst() returns an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), the required structure for returning data from a NodeModel node.\n\nAstFactory.BuildFunctionCall() calls the RectangularGrid function from GridFunctions.cs.\n\nnew Func>(GridFunction.RectangularGrid) specifies the function and  its parameters .\n\nnew List { inputAstNodes[0], inputAstNodes[1], sliderValue }); maps the node inputs to function parameters\n\nAstFactory.BuildNullNode() builds a null node if the input ports are not connected. This is to avoid displaying a warning on the node.\n\nRaisePropertyChanged(\"SliderValue\")Notifies the UI when the slider value changes\n\nvar sliderValue = AstFactory.BuildDoubleNode(SliderValue)Build a node in the AST that represents the slider value\n\nChange an input to the sliderValue variable in the functionCall variable new List { inputAstNodes[0], sliderValue });\n\n\n3. Call a function\nThe CustomNodeModelFunction project will be built into a separate assembly from CustomNodeModel so that it can be called.\nCopy the following code into GridFunction.cs.\nusing Autodesk.DesignScript.Geometry;\nusing Autodesk.DesignScript.Runtime;\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\nnamespace CustomNodeModel.CustomNodeModelFunction\n{\n    [IsVisibleInDynamoLibrary(false)]\n    public class GridFunction\n    {\n        [IsVisibleInDynamoLibrary(false)]\n        public static List RectangularGrid(int xCount = 10, int yCount = 10, double rand = 1)\n        {\n            double x = 0;\n            double y = 0;\n\n            Point pt = null;\n            Vector vec = null;\n            Plane bP = null;\n\n            Random rnd = new Random(2);\n\n            var pList = new List();\n            for (int i = 0; i \nThis function class is very similar to the Zero-Touch Grid case study with one difference:\n\n[IsVisibleInDynamoLibrary(false)] prevents Dynamo from \"seeing\" the following method and class since the function is already being called from CustomNodeModel.\n\nJust as we added references for NuGet packages, CustomNodeModel will need to reference CustomNodeModelFunction to call the function.\n\n\nThe using statement for CustomNodeModel will be inactive until we reference the function  \n\nRight-click on CustomNodeModel and select Add > Reference  \nChoose Projects > Solution  \nCheck CustomNodeModelFunction  \nClick Ok\n\n\n4.

One of the largest changes that will effect node and package authors is our move to a JSON file format.\nIn general Zero Touch node authors will have little to no work to do to get their packages running in 2.0.\nUI nodes and nodes that derive directly from NodeModel will take more work to get running in 2.x.\nExtension authors may also have some potential changes to make - depending on how much of the Dynamo core APIs they use in their extensions.\n\nGeneral packaging rules:\n\nDo not bundle Dynamo or Dynamo Revit .dlls with your package. These dlls will already be loaded by dynamo. If you bundle a different version than the user has loaded (ie you distribute dynamo core 1.3 but the user is running your package on dynamo 2.0) mysterious runtime bugs will occur. This includes dlls like DynamoCore.dll, DynamoServices.dll, DSCodeNodes.dll, ProtoGeometry.dll\n\nDo not bundle and distribute newtonsoft.json.net with your package if you can avoid it. This dll will also be loaded by dynamo 2.x already. The same issue as above can occur.\n\nDo not bundle and distribute CEFSharp with your package if you can avoid it. This dll will also be loaded by Dynamo 2.x already. The same issue as above can occur.\n\nIn general avoid sharing dependencies with dynamo or revit if you need to control the version of that dependency.\n\n\n\nCommon Issues:\n1) Upon opening a graph some nodes have multiple ports with the same name, but the graph looked fine when saving. This issue can have a few causes.\nThe common root cause is because the node was created using a constructor that recreated the ports. Instead a constructor which loaded the ports should have been used. These constructors are usually marked [JsonConstructor] see below for examples\n\nThis can occur because:\n\nThere was simply no matching [JsonConstructor], or it was not passed the Inports and Outports from the JSON .dyn.\n\nThere were two versions of JSON.net loaded into the same process at the same time causing .net runtime failure so that the [JsonConstructor] attribute could not be used correctly to mark the constructor.\n\nDynamoServices.dll with a different version than the current dynamo version has been bundled with the package and is causing the .net runtime to fail to identify the [MultiReturn] attribute so zero touch nodes marked with various attributes will fail to have them applied. You might find that a node returns a single dictionary output instead of multiple ports.\n\n\n2) Nodes are completely missing upon loading the graph with some errors in the console.\n\nThis might occur if your deserialization failed for some reason. It's good practice to serialize only properties you need. We can use [JsonIgnore] on complex properties you don't need to load or save to ignore them. Properties like a function pointer, delegate, action, or  event etc. These should not be serialized as they will usually fail to deserialize and cause a runtime error.\n\n\nUpgrading In Depth:\nCustom Nodes 1.3 - > 2.0\nOrganizing Custom Nodes in librarie.js\nKnown Issues:\n\nA coinciding custom node name and category name at the same level in librarie.js causes unexpected behavior. QNTM-3653 - avoid using the same names for category and nodes.\n\nComments will be turned into block comments instead of line comments.\n\nShort type names will be replaced with full names. For example if you did not specify a type when you load the custom node again you will see var[]..[] - as this is the default type.\n\n\n\nZero Touch Nodes 1.3 -> 2.0\n\nIn Dynamo 2.0 List and Dictionary types have been split and the syntax for creating Lists and Dictionaries has been changed. Lists are initialized using [] while dictionaries use {}.If you were previously using the DefaultArgument attribute to mark parameters on your zero touch nodes and used list syntax to default to a specific list like someFunc([DefaultArgument(\"{0,1,2}\")]) - this will no longer be valid, and you will need to modify the DesignScript snippet to use the new initialization syntax for lists.\n\nAs noted above do not distribute Dynamo dlls with your packages. (DynamoCore, DynamoServices etc).\n\n\n\nNode Model Nodes 1.3 -> 2.0\nNode Model nodes require the most work to update to Dynamo 2.x. At a high level you will need to implement constructors that will only be used for loading your nodes from json in addition to the regular nodeModel constructors that are used for instantiating new instances of your node types. To differentiate between these you mark the load time constructors with [JsonConstructor] which is an attribute from newtonsoft.Json.net.\nThe names of the parameters in the constructor should generally match the names of the JSON properties - though this mapping gets more complicated if you override the names that are serialized using [JsonProperty] attributes.See the Json.net documentation for more information.\n\nJSON Constructors\nThe most common change required for updating nodes derived from the NodeModel base class (or other dynamo core base classes, ie DSDropDownBase) is the need to add a JSON constructor to your class.\nYour original parameter-less constructor will still handle initializing a new node that is created within Dynamo (via the library for example).  The JSON constructor is required to initialize a node that is deserialized (loaded) from a saved .dyn or .dyf file.\nThe JSON constructor differs from the base constructor in that it has PortModel parameters for the inPorts and outPorts, which are provided by the JSON loading logic. The call to register the ports for the node are not required here, as the data exists in the .dyn file.  An example of a JSON constructor looks like this:\nusing Newtonsoft.Json; //New dependency for Json\n………\n[JsonConstructor] //Attribute required to identity the Json constructor\n//Minimum constructor implementation.  Note that the base method invocation must also be present.\nFooNode(IEnumerable inPorts, IEnumerable outPorts) : base(inPorts, outPorts) { }\nThis syntax :base(Inports,outPorts){} calls the base nodeModel constructor and passes the deserialized ports to it.\nAny special logic that existed in the class constructor that involves initialization of specific data that is serialized into the .dyn file (for example setting Port registration, lacing strategy, etc) are not required to be repeated in this constructor as these values can be read from the JSON.\nThis is the major difference between the JSON constructor and non-JSON constructors for your nodeModels. JSON constructors are invoked when loading from a file and are passed loaded data.  Other user logic however must be duplicated in the JSON constructor (for example, initializing event handlers for the node or attaching).\nExamples can be found here in the DynamoSamples repo -> ButtonCustomNodeModel, DropDown, or SliderCustomNodeModel\n\nPublic Properties and Serialization\nPreviously a developer could serialize and deserialize specific model data to the xml document via the SerializeCore and DeserializeCore methods.  These methods still exist in the API but will be deprecated in a future release of Dynamo (an example can be found here). With the JSON.NET implementation now public properties on the NodeModel derived class can be serialized to the .dyn file directly.  JSON.Net provides multiple attributes to control how the property is serialized.\nThis example which specifies a PropertyName is found here in the Dynamo repo.\n[JsonProperty(PropertyName = \"InputValue\")]\npublic DSColor DsColor {...\n\nConverters:\nNote If you make your own JSON.net converter class, Dynamo does not currently have a mechanism to let you inject it into the load and save methods and so even if you mark your class with the [JsonConverter] attribute it may not be used - instead you can call your converter directly in your setter or getter. //TODO need confirmation of this limitation. Any evidence is welcome.\nAn example that specifies a serialization method to convert the property to a string is found here in the Dynamo repo.\n[JsonProperty(\"MeasurementType\"), JsonConverter(typeof(StringEnumConverter))]\npublic ConversionMetricUnit SelectedMetricConversion{...\n\nIgnoring Properties\npublic properties that are not meant for serialization need to have the [JsonIgnore] attribute added.  When the nodes is saved to the .dyn file this insures this data is ignored by the serialization mechanism and will not cause unexpected consequences when the graph is opened again.  An example of this can be here in the Dynamo repo.\n\nUndo/Redo\nAs mentioned above SerializeCore and DeserializeCore methods were used in the past to save and load nodes into the xml .dyn file. In addition they were also used to save and load the node state for undo/redo and still are! If you wish to implement complex undo/redo functionality for your nodeModel UI node then you will need to implement these methods and serialize into the XML document object provided as a parameter to these methods. This should be a rare use case except for complex UI nodes.\n\nInput and Output Port APIs\nOne common occurrence in nodeModel nodes affected by 2.0 API changes is port registration in the node constructor.  Looking at examples in the Dynamo or DynamoSamples repo you previously will have found use of the InPortData.Add() or OutPortData.Add() methods.  Previously in the Dynamo API the InPortData and OutPortData public properties were marked as deprecated.  In 2.0 these properties have been removed.  Developers should now use InPorts.Add() and OutPorts.Add() methods.  Additionally these two Add() methods have slightly different signatures:\nInPortData.Add(new PortData(\"Port Name\", \"Port Description\")); //Old version valid in 1.3 but now deprecated\nvs\nInPorts.Add(new PortModel(PortType.Input, this, new PortData(\"Port Name\", \"Port Description\"))); //Recommended 2.0\nExamples of converted code can be found here in the Dynamo Repo -> DynamoConvert.cs, or FileSystem.cs\nThe other common use case that is affected by the 2.0 API changes relates to the methods commonly used in the BuildAst() method to determine node behavior based on the presence or absence of port connectors.  Previously HasConnectedInput(index) was used to validate a connected port state.  Developers should now use the InPorts[0].IsConnected property to check the port connection state.  An example of the this con be found in ColorRange.cs in the Dynamo Repo.\n\nExamples:\nLet's walk through upgrading a 1.3 UI node to Dynamo 2.x.\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing Dynamo.Graph.Nodes;\nusing CustomNodeModel.CustomNodeModelFunction;\nusing ProtoCore.AST.AssociativeAST;\nusing Autodesk.DesignScript.Geometry;\n\nnamespace CustomNodeModel.CustomNodeModel\n{\n    [NodeName(\"RectangularGrid\")]\n    [NodeDescription(\"An example NodeModel node that creates a rectangular grid. The slider randomly scales the cells.\")]\n    [NodeCategory(\"CustomNodeModel\")]\n    [InPortNames(\"xCount\", \"yCount\")]\n    [InPortTypes(\"double\", \"double\")]\n    [InPortDescriptions(\"Number of cells in the X direction\", \"Number of cells in the Y direction\")]\n    [OutPortNames(\"Rectangles\")]\n    [OutPortTypes(\"Autodesk.DesignScript.Geometry.Rectangle[]\")]\n    [OutPortDescriptions(\"A list of rectangles\")]\n    [IsDesignScriptCompatible]\n    public class GridNodeModel : NodeModel\n    {\n        private double _sliderValue;\n        public double SliderValue\n        {\n            get { return _sliderValue; }\n            set\n            {\n                _sliderValue = value;\n                RaisePropertyChanged(\"SliderValue\");\n                OnNodeModified(false);\n            }\n        }\n        public GridNodeModel()\n        {\n            RegisterAllPorts();\n        }\n        public override IEnumerable BuildOutputAst(List inputAstNodes)\n        {\n            if (!HasConnectedInput(0) || !HasConnectedInput(1))\n            {\n                return new[] { AstFactory.BuildAssignment(GetAstIdentifierForOutputIndex(0), AstFactory.BuildNullNode()) };\n            }\n            var sliderValue = AstFactory.BuildDoubleNode(SliderValue);\n            var functionCall =\n              AstFactory.BuildFunctionCall(\n                new Func>(GridFunction.RectangularGrid),\n                new List { inputAstNodes[0], inputAstNodes[1], sliderValue });\n\n            return new[] { AstFactory.BuildAssignment(GetAstIdentifierForOutputIndex(0), functionCall) };\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAll we need to do to this nodeModel class to get it loading and saving correctly in 2.0 is add a jsonConstructor to handle loading of the ports. We simply pass the ports on the base constructor and this implementation is empty.\n[JsonConstructor]\nprotected GridNodeModel(IEnumerable Inports, IEnumerable Outports ) :\nbase(Inports,Outports)\n{\n\n}\n\nNote: Do not call RegisterPorts() or some variation of that in your JsonConstructor - this will use the input and output parameter attributes on your node class to construct new ports! We don't want this, since we want to use the loaded ports which are passed to your constructor.\n[InPortNames(\"xCount\", \"yCount\")]\n[InPortTypes(\"double\", \"double\")]\nThis example adds the minimal loading JSON constructor possible. But what if we need to do some more complex construction logic, like setup some listeners for event handling inside the constructor. The next sample taken from theDynamoSamples Repo is linked above in the JsonConstructors Section of this document.\nHere is a more complex constructor for a UI node:\n public ButtonCustomNodeModel()\n        {\n            // When you create a UI node, you need to do the\n            // work of setting up the ports yourself. To do this,\n            // you can populate the InPorts and the OutPorts\n            // collections with PortData objects describing your ports.\n            InPorts.Add(new PortModel(PortType.Input, this, new PortData(\"inputString\", \"a string value displayed on our button\")));\n\n            // Nodes can have an arbitrary number of inputs and outputs.\n            // If you want more ports, just create more PortData objects.\n            OutPorts.Add(new PortModel(PortType.Output, this, new PortData(\"button value\", \"returns the string value displayed on our button\")));\n            OutPorts.Add(new PortModel(PortType.Output, this, new PortData(\"window value\", \"returns the string value displayed in our window when button is pressed\")));\n\n            // This call is required to ensure that your ports are\n            // properly created.\n            RegisterAllPorts();\n\n            // Listen for input port disconnection to trigger button UI update\n            this.PortDisconnected += ButtonCustomNodeModel_PortDisconnected;\n\n            // The arugment lacing is the way in which Dynamo handles\n            // inputs of lists. If you don't want your node to\n            // support argument lacing, you can set this to LacingStrategy.Disabled.\n            ArgumentLacing = LacingStrategy.Disabled;\n\n            // We create a DelegateCommand object which will be \n            // bound to our button in our custom UI. Clicking the button \n            // will call the ShowMessage method.\n            ButtonCommand = new DelegateCommand(ShowMessage, CanShowMessage);\n\n            // Setting our property here will trigger a \n            // property change notification and the UI \n            // will be updated to reflect the new value.\n            ButtonText = defaultButtonText;\n            WindowText = defaultWindowText;\n        }\n\nWhen we add a JSON constructor for loading this node from a file we have to recreate some of this logic, but note that we do not include the code that creates ports, sets lacing, or sets the default values for properties which we can load from the file.\n        // This constructor is called when opening a Json graph.\n\n        [JsonConstructor]\n        ButtonCustomNodeModel(IEnumerable inPorts, IEnumerable outPorts) : base(inPorts, outPorts)\n        {\n            this.PortDisconnected += ButtonCustomNodeModel_PortDisconnected;\n            ButtonCommand = new DelegateCommand(ShowMessage, CanShowMessage);\n        }\n\nNote that other public properties that were serialized into the JSON like ButtonText and WindowText will not to be added as explicit parameters to the constructor - they are set automatically by JSON.net using the setters for those properties.\n"},"03-Development-Options/3-6-extensions.html":{"url":"03-Development-Options/3-6-extensions.html","title":"Extensions","keywords":"","body":"Extensions\nExtensions are a powerful development tool in the Dynamo ecosystem.  They allow for developers to drive custom functionality based on Dynamo interactions and logic.  Extensions can be broken down into two main categories, extensions and view extensions.  As the naming implies, the view extension framework allows you to extend the Dynamo UI by registering custom menu items.  Regular extensions operate in a very similar fashion minus the UI.  For instance, we could build an extension that logs specific information to the Dynamo console.  This scenario requires no custom UI and therefore could also be accomplished using an extension.\nExtension Case Study\nFollowing the SampleViewExtension example from the DynamoSamples Github repository, we will walk through the steps necessary to create a simple modeless window that displays the active nodes in the graph in real-time. A view extension requires that we create a UI for the window and bind values to a view model.\n\n\n\nThe view extension window developed following the SampleViewExtension example in the Github repository.\n\n\nThough we will build the example from the ground up, you can also download and build the DynamoSamples repository to serve as a reference.\nThe DynamoSamples repository: https://github.com/DynamoDS/DynamoSamples\n\nThis walk-through will be specifically referencing the project named SampleViewExtension found in DynamoSamples/src/.\n\nHow to implement a view extension\nA view extension has three essential parts:\n\nAn assembly containing a class that implements IViewExtension as well as a class that creates a view model\nAn .xml file that tells Dynamo where it should look for this assembly at runtime, and the type of extension\nAn .xaml file that binds data to the graphic display and determines the window's appearance\n\n1. Create the project structure\nStart by creating a new Class Library project named SampleViewExtension.\n\n\n\nCreate a new project by selecting File > New > Project\nSelect Class Library\nName the project SampleViewExtension\nSelect Ok\n\n\nIn this project, we will need two classes. One class will implement IViewExtension and another that will implement NotificationObject. IViewExtension will contain all the information about how our extension will be deployed, loaded, referenced, and disposed.  NotificationObject will provide notifications for changes in Dynamo and IDisposable When a change occurs the count will update accordingly.\n\n\n\nA class file named SampleViewExtension.cs that will implement IViewExtension\nA class file named SampleWindowViewMode.cs that will implement NotificationObject\n\n\nTo use IViewExtension, we will need the WpfUILibrary NuGet package. Installing this package will automatically install the Core, Services, and ZeroTouchLibrary packages.\n\n\n\nSelect the WpfUILibrary\nSelect Install to install all dependent packages\n\n\n2. Implement the IViewExtension class\nFrom the IViewExtension class we will determine what happens when Dynamo starts up, when the extension is loaded, and when Dynamo shuts down. In the SampleViewExtension.cs class file, add the following code:\nusing System;\nusing System.Windows;\nusing System.Windows.Controls;\nusing Dynamo.Wpf.Extensions;\n\nnamespace SampleViewExtension\n{\n\n    public class SampleViewExtension : IViewExtension\n    {\n        private MenuItem sampleMenuItem;\n\n        public void Dispose()\n        {\n        }\n\n        public void Startup(ViewStartupParams p)\n        {\n        }\n\n        public void Loaded(ViewLoadedParams p)\n        {\n            // Save a reference to your loaded parameters.\n            // You'll need these later when you want to use\n            // the supplied workspaces\n\n            sampleMenuItem = new MenuItem {Header = \"Show View Extension Sample Window\"};\n            sampleMenuItem.Click += (sender, args) =>\n            {\n                var viewModel = new SampleWindowViewModel(p);\n                var window = new SampleWindow\n                {\n                    // Set the data context for the main grid in the window.\n                    MainGrid = { DataContext = viewModel },\n\n                    // Set the owner of the window to the Dynamo window.\n                    Owner = p.DynamoWindow\n                };\n\n                window.Left = window.Owner.Left + 400;\n                window.Top = window.Owner.Top + 200;\n\n                // Show a modeless window.\n                window.Show();\n            };\n            p.AddMenuItem(MenuBarType.View, sampleMenuItem);\n        }\n\n        public void Shutdown()\n        {\n        }\n\n        public string UniqueId\n        {\n            get\n            {\n                return Guid.NewGuid().ToString();\n            }  \n        } \n\n        public string Name\n        {\n            get\n            {\n                return \"Sample View Extension\";\n            }\n        } \n\n    }\n}\n\nThe SampleViewExtension class creates a clickable menu item to open the window and connects it to the view model and window.\n\npublic class SampleViewExtension : IViewExtension SampleViewExtension inherits from the IViewExtension interface provides everything we need to create the menu item.\n\nsampleMenuItem = new MenuItem { Header = \"Show View Extension Sample Window\" }; creates a MenuItem and adds it to the View menu.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe menu item\n\n\n\nsampleMenuItem.Click += (sender, args) triggers an event that will open a new window when the menu item is clicked\n\nMainGrid = { DataContext = viewModel } sets the data context for the main grid in the window, referring to Main Grid in the .xaml file we will create\n\nOwner = p.DynamoWindow sets the owner of our pop-out window to Dynamo.  This means the new window is dependent on Dynamo so actions such as minimizing, maximizing, and restoring Dynamo will cause the new window to follow this same behavior\n\nwindow.Show(); displays the window the additional window properties have been set\n\n\n3. Implementing the view model\nNow that we have established some of the window's basic parameters, we will add the logic for responding to various Dynamo related events and instruct the UI to update based on these events. Copy the following code into the SampleWindowViewModel.cs class file:\nusing System;\nusing Dynamo.Core;\nusing Dynamo.Extensions;\nusing Dynamo.Graph.Nodes;\n\nnamespace SampleViewExtension\n{\n    public class SampleWindowViewModel : NotificationObject, IDisposable\n    {\n        private string activeNodeTypes;\n        private ReadyParams readyParams;\n\n        // Displays active nodes in the workspace\n        public string ActiveNodeTypes\n        {\n            get\n            {\n                activeNodeTypes = getNodeTypes();\n                return activeNodeTypes;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Helper function that builds string of active nodes\n        public string getNodeTypes()\n        {\n            string output = \"Active nodes:\\n\";\n\n            foreach (NodeModel node in readyParams.CurrentWorkspaceModel.Nodes)\n            {\n                string nickName = node.Name;\n                output += nickName + \"\\n\";\n            }\n\n            return output;\n        }\n\n        public SampleWindowViewModel(ReadyParams p)\n        {\n            readyParams = p;\n            p.CurrentWorkspaceModel.NodeAdded += CurrentWorkspaceModel_NodesChanged;\n            p.CurrentWorkspaceModel.NodeRemoved += CurrentWorkspaceModel_NodesChanged;\n        }\n\n        private void CurrentWorkspaceModel_NodesChanged(NodeModel obj)\n        {\n            RaisePropertyChanged(\"ActiveNodeTypes\");\n        }\n\n        public void Dispose()\n        {\n            readyParams.CurrentWorkspaceModel.NodeAdded -= CurrentWorkspaceModel_NodesChanged;\n            readyParams.CurrentWorkspaceModel.NodeRemoved -= CurrentWorkspaceModel_NodesChanged;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis implementation of the view model class listens to the CurrentWorkspaceModel and triggers an event when a node is added or removed from the workspace.  This raises a property change that notifies the UI or bound elements that the data has changed and needs to be updated. The ActiveNodeTypes getter is called which internally calls an additional helper function getNodeTypes().  This function iterates through all the active nodes on the canvas, populate a string containing the names of these nodes, and returns this string to our binding in the .xaml file to be displayed in our pop-out window.\nWith the core logic of the extension defined, we will now specify the appearance details of the window with an .xaml file. All we need is a simple window that will display the string via the ActiveNodeTypes property binding in theTextBlock Text.\n\n\n\nRight-click on the project and select Add > New Item...\nSelect the User Control template which we will alter to create a window\nName the new file SampleWindow.xaml\nSelect Add\n\n\nIn the window .xaml code, we will need to bind SelectedNodesText to a text block. Add the following code to SampleWindow.xaml:\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\nText=\"{Binding ActiveNodeTypes}\" binds to the property value of ActiveNodeTypes in SampleWindowViewModel.cs to the TextBlock Text value in the window.\n\nWe will now initialize the sample window in the .xaml C# backing file SampleWindow.xaml.cs. Add the following code to SampleWindow.xaml:\nusing System.Windows;\n\nnamespace SampleViewExtension\n{\n    /// \n    /// Interaction logic for SampleWindow.xaml\n    /// \n    public partial class SampleWindow : Window\n    {\n        public SampleWindow()\n        {\n            InitializeComponent();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe view extension is now ready to be built and added to Dynamo.  Dynamo requires an xml file in order to register our output .dll as an extension.\n\n\n\nRight-click on the project and select Add > New Item...\nSelect XML file\nName the file SampleViewExtension_ViewExtensionDefinition.xml\nSelect Add\n\n\n\nThe file name follows the Dynamo standard for referencing an extension assembly like so: \"extensionName\"_ViewExtensionDefinition.xml\n\nIn the xml file, add the following code to tell Dynamo where to look for the extension assembly:\n\n  C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2015\\Projects\\SampleViewExtension\\SampleViewExtension\\bin\\Debug\\SampleViewExtension.dll\n  SampleViewExtension.SampleViewExtension\n\n\n\nIn this example, we built the assembly to the default Visual Studio project folder. Replace the ... target with the location of the assembly.\n\nThe last step is to copy the SampleViewExtension_ViewExtensionDefinition.xml file into Dynamo's view extensions folder located in the Dynamo Core installation directory C:\\Program Files\\Dynamo\\Dynamo Core\\1.3\\viewExtensions.  It is important to note that there are separate folders for extensions and viewExtensions.  Placing the xml file in the incorrect folder may cause failure to properly load at runtime.\n\n\n\nThe .xml file we copied into Dynamo's view extensions folder\n\n\nThis is a basic introduction to view extensions. For a more sophisticated case study see the DynaShape package, an open source project on Github. The package uses a view extension that enables live editing in the Dynamo model view.\nA package installer for DynaShape can be downloaded from the Dynamo Forum: https://forum.dynamobim.com/t/dynashape-published/11666\nThe source code can be cloned from Github: https://github.com/LongNguyenP/DynaShape\n"},"04-Testing/4-0-testing.html":{"url":"04-Testing/4-0-testing.html","title":"Testing","keywords":"","body":"Testing\nTests give developers a way to ensure reliability and dramatically improve the quality of third-party development. For the Dynamo project, tests are expected with pull requests to help the Dynamo development team know that a new feature or bug fix is robust. The Dynamo source repository contains thousands of unit tests and is an excellent reference for learning how to write one. The DynamoSamples repository also contains basic examples of tests that we will walk through in this section.\nIntroduction to testing expectations\nUnit tests are expected when making a pull request to Dynamo and are generally a good practice during development. They need to be included in pull requests for the following reasons:\n\nTo prove how a current behavior is broken for a bug we want to fix.\nTo prove the reliability of a new feature, new node or even just new APIs.\n\nFor example, if another contributor makes a change that causes a node we created to stop functioning properly, it should also cause any tests we created to fail. This helps to eliminate possible causes of an issue and identify its source.\nUnit and System tests\nThe Dynamo project uses two types of tests: unit and system.\n\nUnit tests test small \"units\" of code, such as methods, to find logic errors.\n\nSystem tests test the entire system similar to how a user would interact with Dynamo. This typically involves creating a Dynamo session, opening a Dynamo file, evaluating it, and ensuring that the results are what we expected.\n\n\nTest dependencies\nSeveral libraries are provided with Dynamo that contain base classes and utility methods for testing. If we want to write a test in a package we are developing, we will need to reference the DynamoVisualProgramming.Testing package from the NuGet package manager to get the following libraries:\n\nTestServices.dll contains the base class for Dynamo unit tests.\nSystemTestServices.dll contains the base class for Dynamo system tests.\n\nThese libraries contain base classes that will handle operations such as initializing Dynamo and its geometry library for unit tests or providing access to the Dynamo workspace in system tests.\n\nGeometricTestBase for unit tests that use the geometry library\nSystemTestBase for system tests that start Dynamo and use .dyn files\n\nHow to run a test\nBefore we write a test, running one located in Dynamo's source files will illustrate the process and results.\nFirst we need to install the NUnit 2 Test Adapter so that Visual Studio discovers the tests.\nIn Visual Studio open the Dynamo solution file Dynamo.All.sln and the Test Explorer. Set the test settings to x64 otherwise the tests will not run, then build the solution.\n\n\n\nSelect Test > Windows > TestExplorer to show the tests\nThe TestExplorer window\nSelect Test > Test Settings > Default Processor Architecture > X64\nBuild the project by selecting Build > Build Solution. All available tests will appear in the TestExplorer Not Run Tests category.\n\n\nSelect a test to run. The CanSaveImage() test from DynamoCoreWpfTests will test Dynamo for whether or not it can save an image. Running the test will open Dynamo, add a node, and capture an image all very quickly.\n\n\n\nSearch for CanSaveImage\nRight-click on the test and select Run Selected Tests. If the test runs successfully it will be under the Passed Test category.\nTime elapsed for the test\nThe output of the test. Here we can see that the test created a new home workspace.\n\n\nHow to write tests for a package\nMost tests we create for packages will be unit tests. They should be small, fast, and reliable. If we want to test a Zero-Touch node, the test should test only that DLL and make calls directly to that code. We will walk through how to set up a package with tests using the the DynamoSamples repository.\nStart by downloading the Github repository for DynamoSamples and opening the Visual Studio solution file. We also need to add the Tests package with the NuGet package manager.\n\n\n\nThe Tests package\nInstall for the SampleLibraryTests project\nClick Install\n\n\nTo run tests we need to point the test libraries to Dynamo's installation directory with a TestServices.dll.config file in the SampleTestsLibrary project folder. DynamoSamples already has this file, otherwise we would need to create one.\n\nWe have Dynamo installed in C:\\Program Files\\Dynamo\\Dynamo Core\\1.3\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nNow build the solution to get the tests. If we open the Test Explorer window there should be three tests from the SampleLibraryTests project. Tests should be contained in a separate project. If we wanted to test a method in this project, we would need to reference that library in the test project.\n\n\n\nBuild the solution to get the tests with Build > Build Solution\nA separate SampleLibraryTests project\nThe tests in DynamoSamples\n\n\nThe tests we see in HelloDynamoZeroTouch.cs are very basic but include the key components.\n\nA using NUnit.Framework; statement to use NUnit\nA using TestServices; statement since we are using geometry in the tests\nA [TestFixture] attribute that marks a class that contains tests\nA [Test] attribute that marks a method as a test\nA void method since nothing needs to be returned out\nAn Assert method that upon failure does not return and posts an error\n\nusing System;\nusing Autodesk.DesignScript.Geometry;\nusing Autodesk.DesignScript.Runtime;\nusing NUnit.Framework;\nusing TestServices;\n\nnamespace SampleLibraryTests\n[Test]\n    [TestFixture]\n    [IsVisibleInDynamoLibrary(false)]\n    class HelloDynamoZeroTouchTests : GeometricTestBase\n    {\n        [Test]\n        public void PassingTest()\n        {\n            var myObject = Point.ByCoordinates(5, 5, 5);\n            Assert.NotNull(myObject);\n        }\n\n        [Test]\n        public void FailingTest()\n        {\n            var p1 = Point.ByCoordinates(0, 0, 0);\n            var p2 = Point.ByCoordinates(0, 0, 0);\n            Assert.Throws(()=>Line.ByStartPointEndPoint(p1,p2));\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\npublic void FailingTest() tests if Dynamo will throw an exception when the Line.ByStartPointEndPoint(p1,p2) method is given identical points, which is impossible to create a line from.\n\nIf we replace the Assert statement in the FailingTest with Assert.NotNull(myObject);, we are testing if Line.ByStartPointEndPoint(p1,p2) can create a line from points in at identical locations. Replace the code and run the test to see what a failure looks like.\n\n\n\nThe Assert statement we modified\nThe failed FailingTest. Normally this is testing if the node can fail by throwing an exception.\nInformation about the test results\n\n\nNow we are set up to write tests for any package we create. For an extensive list of reference tests take a look at the Dynamo source.\n"},"04-Testing/4-1-revit-testing.html":{"url":"04-Testing/4-1-revit-testing.html","title":"Testing for DynamoRevit","keywords":"","body":"Testing for DynamoRevit\nIf we are developing a package for Revit or working with the DynamoRevit source code, the tests we write need to incorporate both Revit and Dynamo functionality. A test could involve opening both a Revit file and Dynamo file, then adding a DynamoRevit node to the workspace to simulate how a user would create a graph. Writing a test for DynamoRevit will generally follow the walk-through in the Testing section with the addition of several steps. Running tests for Revit and DynamoRevit is a more involved process since we are launching multiple applications and referencing other libraries.\nThe Revit Test Framework\nThe Revit Test Framework (RTF) allows for remote testing on Revit. RTF creates a journal file for running Revit, specifies a model for it to open, and a specific test or fixture of tests to run. A model can also be specified to open before testing to run several tests with.\nThe Revit Test Framework is open source and hosted on Github: https://github.com/DynamoDS/RevitTestFramework\n\nUsing the same git commands from the walk-through in Build DynamoRevit From Source, we can clone and build the repository to run RTF. Open a new command prompt and enter the following commands:\n\ncd \"C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\GitHub\" to set the directory into which the repository will be cloned\ngit clone https://github.com/DynamoDS/RevitTestFramework.git to clone the repository from its URL\ncd \"C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\GitHub\\RevitTestFramework\" to set the current directory to the repository\ngit checkout Revit2018 switches to a branch of RTF matching the installed Revit version, similar to the process in building DynamoRevit from source\n\nOnce the repository is cloned, open the solution file in Visual Studio and build the solution. In the bin folder are two options for running RTF:\n\nRevitTestFrameworkGUI.exe provides a visual interface to select tests from a treeview and visualize the results of the tests as they are run. Testing configurations can be saved to run again later.\nRevitTestFrameworkConsole.exe is a console application which allows running RTF from a command line. All the settings in the GUI are available here as well.\n\nHow to run a test for DynamoRevit in the GUI\nTests are run in the RevitTestFramework by specifying an assembly containing the tests and any supporting references. We can start by running a test that comes with the DynamoRevit repository in the GUI application. Start by opening the RevitTestFrameworkGUI.exe application in the bin folder of the build.\n\n\nRTF loads a default test from its bin folder when it starts  \n\nSelect File to save or load a local RTF config  \nSet the Test Assembly path, the location of the assembly containing the tests to run. (e.x. RevitNodesTests.dll, RevitSystemTests.dll, RevitServicesTests.dll which can be found usually in DynamoRevit bin folder)  \nSet the Results File Path, the result file is an.xml file that will contain the test results. If the path points to an existing file, RTF will overwrite it  \nSet the Working Directory, the location of the testing files  \nSet the Additional Resolution Directories to assemblies that the test assembly will need to load (e.x. the Dynamo Core location when it is not set in the Dynamo.Config in DynamoRevit bin folder)  \nSpecify the Revit version to run the tests with  \nSelect Debug to launch a debugging session with the test  \nSelect Run Selected Tests to run the tests\n\n\nFor this example we will run one test from RevitSystemTests. Add the RevitSystemTests assembly from DynamoRevit and select CreateWallByFace under WallTests. If the assembly does not load, try adding SystemTestServices.dll to Additional Resolution Directories from DynamoCore.\n\n\nThe test passed, shown by the green highlighting. The name of the Revit model associated with a test will turn green if the working directory is set correctly.  \n\nSet the Test Assembly, Results File Path, and the Working Directory  \nSelect only the CreateWallByFace test  \nSelect Run Selected Tests\n\n\nWhether a test passes or fails, it will write its results to the file specified in Results File Path. The output file from a test run is an NUnit-formatted results file compatible with many CI systems. Open the Test_Results.xml file for more information on the test we just ran.\n﻿\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nSince this test configuration is working, we can save these settings for another session in a .xml file.\n\n\n\nSelect File > Save As...\n\n\nHow to run a test for DynamoRevit in the Console\nAlternatively, we can run tests from the command line with all the options we had in the GUI application. Open a command prompt from the directory of the RevitTestFrameworkConsole.exe application and enter the following command:\n\nRevitTestFrameworkConsole -h shows all available commands\n\n  Options:   \n         --dir=[VALUE]          The full path to the working directory. The working directory is the directory in which RTF will generate the journal and the addin to Run Revit. Revit's run-by-journal capability requires that all addins which need to be loaded are in the same directory as the journal file. So, if you're testing other addins on top of Revit using RTF, you'll need to put those addins in whatever directory you specify as the working directory.  \n    -a,  --assembly=[VALUE]     The full path to the assembly containing your tests.  \n    -r,  --results=[VALUE]      This is the full path to an .xml file that will contain the results. \n    -f,  --fixture=[VALUE]      The full name (with namespace) of a test fixture to run. If no fixture, no category and no test names are specified, RTF will run all tests in the assembly.(OPTIONAL)  \n    -t,  --testName[=VALUE]     The name of a test to run. If no fixture, no category and no test names are specified, RTF will run all tests in the assembly. (OPTIONAL)    \n         --category[=VALUE]     The name of a test category to run. If no fixture, no category and no test names are specified, RTF will run all tests in the assembly. (OPTIONAL)   \n         --exclude[=VALUE]      The name of a test category to exclude. This has a higher priortiy than other settings. If a specified category is set here, any test cases that belongs to that category will not be run. (OPTIONAL)  \n    -c,  --concatenate          Concatenate the results from this run of RTF with an existing results file if one exists at the path specified. The default behavior is to replace the existing results file. (OPTIONAL)  \n         --revit[=VALUE]        The Revit executable to be used for testing. If no executable is specified, RTF will use the first version of Revit that is found on the machine using the RevitAddinUtility. (OPTIONAL)  \n         --copyAddins           Specify whether to copy the addins from the Revit folder to the current working directory. Copying the addins from the Revit folder will cause the test process to simulate the typical setup on your machine. (OPTIONAL)  \n         --dry                  Conduct a dry run. (OPTIONAL)  \n    -x,  --clean                Cleanup journal files after test completion. (OPTIONAL)   \n         --continuous           Run all selected tests in one Revit session. (OPTIONAL)  \n         --time                 The time, in milliseconds, after which RTF will close the testing process automatically. (OPTIONAL)  \n    -d,  --debug                Should RTF attempt to attach to a debugger?. (OPTIONAL)  \n    -h,  --help                 Show this message and exit. (OPTIONAL)\nIf we wanted to run the same test that we did in the GUI, we can specify all options in a single command separated by spaces.\n\nRevitTestFrameworkConsole precedes the options\n--dir=\"C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\DynamoRevit\\test\\System\" sets the working directory\n-a=\"C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\DynamoRevit\\bin\\AnyCPU\\Debug\\Revit_2017\\RevitSystemTests.dll\" sets the test assembly\n-r=\"C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\RevitTestFramework\\bin\\AnyCPU\\Debug\\Test_Results.xml\" sets the results file path\n-t=CreateWallByFace specifies the test to run\n\nHow to write DynamoRevit tests\nWriting a test that involves Dynamo and Revit requires the same setup covered in testing for Dynamo Core with a few extra steps. In addition to the test libraries provided for Dynamo, DynamoRevit provides RevitTestServices.dll, a library containing base classes and methods for testing with Revit. This walk-through will cover how to setup a Visual Studio project for writing a Revit test. First, we need to reference RevitTestServices.dll and a few other assemblies. Create a new Visual Studio project or open an existing one and add the following references.\n\nRevitTestServices.dll contains two base classes, RevitNodeTestBase and RevitSystemTestBase, for unit and system testing that involves Revit\nSystemTestServices.dll is provided by DynamoCore and is required for RevitTestServices.dll\nRevitTestFrameworkTypes.dll is provided by RTF and contains TestModelAttribute for specifying a Revit model to open when a test runs\nDynamoCore.dll contains Dynamo's core model\n\nWe also need to reference these assemblies for this specific example.\n\nDynamoCoreWpf.dll for accessing Dynamo's view model\nRevitNodes.dll for using DynamoRevit nodes\n\n\n\n\nRight click on References and select Add Reference...\nBrowse to the locations of each reference\nAll six references we need for this project\nSelect Ok\n\n\nBy default, these assemblies will be set to Copy Local = True. Once they are added, select them and change this property to False.\n\n\n\nSelect the assemblies we referenced\nSet Copy Local to False\n\n\nFor this example, we can use the CreateWallByFace test as the sample test. Add the following code to an empty class in the project.\nusing System.IO;\nusing NUnit.Framework;\nusing RevitTestServices;\nusing RTF.Framework;\n\nnamespace RevitSystemTests\n{\n    [TestFixture]\n    class WallTests : RevitSystemTestBase\n    {\n        [Test]\n        [TestModel(@\".\\InPlaceMass.rvt\")]\n        public void CreateWallByFace()\n        {\n            var model = ViewModel.Model;\n\n            string samplePath = Path.Combine(workingDirectory, @\".\\Wall\\WallByFace.dyn\");\n            string testPath = Path.GetFullPath(samplePath);\n\n            ViewModel.OpenCommand.Execute(testPath);\n\n            RunCurrentModel();\n\n            var wall = GetPreviewValue(\"e3e5735c-98d2-47ac-97fb-90a5f08c416e\");\n            Assert.IsNotNull(wall);\n            Assert.IsTrue(wall.GetType() == typeof(Revit.Elements.FaceWall));\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe structure of the test is similar to DynamoCore tests with several key differences.\n\nThe RevitTestServices using statement provides Revit test base classes\nThe RTF.Framework using statement provides an attribute used to specify a Revit model\nA class that inherits RevitSystemTestBase to use functions specific to Revit System tests\nA [TestModel(@\".\\InPlaceMass.rvt\")] attribute from RTF to specify a Revit model with which to run the test\nA Dynamo file path string samplePath = Path.Combine(workingDirectory, @\".\\Wall\\WallByFace.dyn\"); that specifies a Dynamo file to run\nA RunCurrentModel() method to run the Dynamo file\n\nNotice that the test uses a test model InPlaceMass.rvt and a Dynamo file WallByFace.dyn. Create a test folder in the project directory and copy these files from the DynamoRevit test folder into it.\n\n\n\nThe Dynamo and Revit files copied from the DynamoRevit repository\nThe test folder inside the project directory that will serve as the working directory\n\n\nNow build the project and run the test in the RTF GUI application.\n\n\n\nSet the test assembly path to the Test.dll we just built\nSpecify a results file\nSet the working directory to the location of the copied Revit and Dynamo files\nMake sure the correct version of Revit is selected, 2018 in this example\nSelect Run Selected Tests\nThe test will become highlighted green if it runs successfully, otherwise it will become highlighted red if it failed\n\n\nThe DynamoRevit repository has many tests to use as a reference when writing new ones for a package under Tests > Libraries in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer.\n"},"05-Package-Deployment/5-0-package-deployment.html":{"url":"05-Package-Deployment/5-0-package-deployment.html","title":"Package Manager Deployment","keywords":"","body":"Publish a Package\nPackages are a convenient way to store and share nodes with the Dynamo community. A package can contain everything from Custom Nodes created in the Dynamo workspace to NodeModel derived nodes. Packages are published and installed using the Package Manager. In addition to this page the Primer has a general guide on packages.\nWhat is a Package Manager?\nThe Dynamo Package Manager is a Software Registry (similar to npm) that can be accessed from Dynamo or in a web browser. The Package Manager includes installing, publishing, updating, and viewing packages. Like npm,  it maintains different versions of packages. It also helps to manage the dependencies of your project.\nIn the browser, search for packages and view statistics: http://dynamopackages.com/\n\nIn Dynamo, the Package Manager includes install, publish, and update packages.\n\n\n\n\nSearch for packages online: Packages > Search for a Package...\nView/edit installed packages: Packages > Manage Packages...\nPublish a new package: Packages > Publish New Package...\n\n\nPublishing a package\nPackages are published from Package Manager within Dynamo. The recommended process is to publish locally, test the package and then publish online to share with the community. Using the NodeModel Case Study, we will go through the necessary steps to publish the RectangularGrid node as a package locally and then on online.\nStart Dynamo and select Packages > Publish New Package... to open the Publish a Package window.\n\n\n\nSelect Add file... to browse for files to add to the package\nSelect the two .dll files from the NodeModel Case Study\nSelect Ok\n\n\nWith the files added to the package contents, give the package a name, description, and version.

This will enable the project to be quickly tested as a package and simulate a user's experience.\nHow to build directly to the package folder\nThere are two methods for building a package in Visual Studio:\n\nAdd post-build events through the Project Settings dialogue that use xcopy or Python scripts to copy the necessary files\nUse the \"AfterBuild\" build target in the .csproj file to create file and directory copy tasks\n\n\"AfterBuild\" is the preferred method for these types of operations (and the one covered in this guide) as it does not rely on  file copying which may not be available on the build machine.\nCopy package files with the AfterBuild Method\nSet up the directory structure in the repository so that the source files are separate from the package files. Working with the CustomNodeModel case study, place the Visual Studio project and all associated files into a new src folder. You will be storing all packages generated by the project in this folder. The folder structure should now look like this:\nCustomNodeModel\n> src\n  > CustomNodeModel\n  > CustomNodeModelFunction\n  > packages\n  > CustomNodeModel.sln\n\n\n\nMove the project files into the new src folder\n\n\nNow that the source files are in a separate folder, add a AfterBuild target to the CustomNodeModel.csproj file in Visual Studio. This should copy the necessary files into a new package folder. Open the CustomNodeModel.csproj file in a text editor (we used Atom) and place the build target before the closing  tag. This AfterBuild target will copy all .dll, .pbd, .xml, and .config files into a new bin folder and creates a dyf and extra folders.\n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\nWe will need to make sure that the target has been added to the CustomNodeModel.csproj file (not another project file) and that the project does not have any existing Post-Build settings.   \n\nPlace AfterBuild target before the end  tag.\n\n\nIn the  section, a number of variables are defined to represent specific file types. For example, the Dll variable represents all files in the ouput directory whose extension is .dll.\n\n  \n\n\n Copy task is to copy all .dll files to a directory, specifically the package folder to which we are building.\n\n\nDynamo packages typically have a dyf and extra folder for Dynamo Custom Nodes and other assets such as images. To create these folders, we need to use a MakeDir task. This task will create a folder if it does not exist. You can add files manually to this folder.\n\n\nIf you build the project, the project folder should now have a packages folder alongside the src folder previously created. Inside the packages directory is a folder containing everything needed for the package. We also need to copy the pkg.json file into the package folder so that Dynamo knows to load the package.\n\n\n\nThe new packages folder that the AfterBuild target created\nThe existing src folder with the project\nThe dyf and extra folders created from the AfterBuild target\nManually copy the pkg.json file.\n\n\nNow you can publish the package using Dynamo's package manager or directly copy it into Dynamo's package directory: \\AppData\\Roaming\\Dynamo\\1.3\\packages.\n"},"05-Package-Deployment/deploying-extensions-on-the-package-manager.html":{"url":"05-Package-Deployment/deploying-extensions-on-the-package-manager.html","title":"Deploying Extensions on the Package Manager","keywords":"","body":"Extensions as Packages\nOverview\nDynamo extensions can be deployed to the package manager just like regular Dynamo node libraries.  When an installed package contains a view extension the extension is loaded at runtime when Dynamo loads.  You can check the Dynamo console to verify the extension has properly loaded.\nPackage Structure\nThe structure of an extension package is the same as a normal package containing...\nC:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Roaming\\Dynamo\\Dynamo Core\\2.1\\packages\\Sample View Extension\n│   pkg.json\n├───bin\n│       SampleViewExtension.dll\n├───dyf\n└───extra\n        SampleViewExtension_ViewExtensionDefinition.xml\nAssuming you have already built your extension you will (at a minimum) have a .NET assebly and a manifest file.  The assembly should contain a class which implements IViewExtension or IExtension.  The manifest .XML file tells Dynamo which class to instantiate in order to launch your extension.  For the package manager to correctly locate the extension the manifest file should accurately correspond to the assembly location and naming.\nPlace any assembly files in the bin folder and the manifest file in the extra folder.  Any additional assets can also be placed in this folder.\nExample manifest .XML file:\n\n  ..\\bin\\MyViewExtension.dll\n  MyViewExtension.MyViewExtension\n\n\nUploading\nOnce you have a folder containing the sub-directories outlined above you are ready to push (upload) to the package manager.  One thing to be aware of is you currently cannot publish packages from Dynamo Sandbox.  This means you need to be using Dynamo Revit.  Once inside Dynamo Revit navigate to Packages => Publish New Package.  This will prompt the user to login to their Autodesk account they wish to associate the package with.\nAt this point you should be at the normal publish package window where you will enter all the require fields regarding your package/extension.  There is one very important additional step which requires you to make sure none of your assembly files are marked as a node library.  This is done by right clicking on the files you have imported (the package folder created above).  A context menu will appear which gives you the option to check (or un-check) this option.  All extension assemblies should be un-checked.\n\nBefore publishing publicly you should always publish locally to make sure everything is functioning as expected.  One this has been verified you are ready to go live by selecting publish.\nPulling\nTo verify your package has been succesffully uploaded you should be able to search for it given the naming and keywords specificed in the publishing step.  Finally, it is important to note that same extensions will require a reboot of Dynamo before functioning.  Usually these extensions require parameters specified when Dynamo boots up.\n\n"},"06-Pull-Requests/6-0-pull-requests.html":{"url":"06-Pull-Requests/6-0-pull-requests.html","title":"Pull Requests","keywords":"","body":"Pull Requests\nDynamo depends on the creativity and commitment of its community, and the Dynamo team encourages contributors to explore possibilities, test ideas, and engage the community for feedback. While innovation is highly encouraged, changes will only be merged if they make Dynamo easier to use and satisfy the guidelines defined in this document. Changes with narrowly-defined benefits will not be merged.\nPull request expectations\nThe Dynamo team expects pull requests to follow a few guidelines:\n\nAdhere to our coding standards and node naming standards\nInclude unit tests when adding new features\nWhen fixing a bug, add a unit test that highlights how the current behavior is broken\nKeep the discussion focused on one issue. Create a new issue if a new or related topic comes up.\n\nAnd a few guidelines on what not to do:\n\nSurprising us with big pull requests. Instead, file an issue and start a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount of time.\nCommit code that you didn't write. If you find code that you think is a good fit to add to Dynamo, file an issue and start a discussion before proceeding.\nSubmit PRs that alter licensing related files or headers. If you believe there's a problem with them, file an issue and we'll be happy to discuss it.\nMake API additions without filing an issue and discussing with us first.\n\nFilling out the pull request template\nWhen submitting a pull request, please use the default PR template. Before submitting your PR, ensure that the purpose is clearly described and all of the declarations can be claimed as true:\n\nThe code base is in a better state after this PR\nIs documented according to the standards\nThe level of testing this PR includes is appropriate\nUser facing strings, if any, are extracted into *.resxfiles\nAll tests pass using the self-service CI\nSnapshot of UI changes, if any\nChanges to the API follow Semantic Versioning, and are documented in the API Changes document.\n\nAn appropriate reviewer will be assigned to your pull request by the Dynamo Team.\nPull request review process\nOnce a pull request is submitted, you may need to stay involved during the review process. Please be aware of the following review criteria:\n\nThe Dynamo team meets once per month to review pull requests from oldest to newest.\nIf a reviewed pull request requires changes by the owner, the owner of the PR has 30 days to respond. If the PR has seen no activity by the next session, it will be either closed by the team or depending on its utility will be taken over by someone on the team.\nPull requests should use Dynamo's default PR template\nPull requests that do not have the Dynamo PR templates completely filled out with all declarations satisfied will not be reviewed.\n\nCherry-picking Dynamo Revit commits\nSince there are multiple versions of Revit available on the market, you may be required to cherry-pick your changes into specific DynamoRevit Release branches so that different versions of Revit can pick up the new functionality. During the review process, contributors will be responsible for cherry-picking their reviewed commits to the other DynamoRevit branches as specified by the Dynamo team.\n"},"07-Examples/7-0-examples.html":{"url":"07-Examples/7-0-examples.html","title":"Examples","keywords":"","body":"Examples\nIf you are looking for examples on how to develop for Dynamo.
